Modelling to study its non-linear effects on Communication System&#x27;s  performance with BER as performance measure;;; Aripirala Manoj Kumar,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Reddy_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">G.Bharath Reddy</a>,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Reddy_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">G. Krishna Chaitanya Reddy</a> ;;; This paper is a study of non-linear effects of RF Amplifiers on Communication Systems Performance. High speed data communication is made possible by Multilevel Modulation schemes. This paper presents a study of these non linear effects on multilevel Modulation schemes like MPSK and MQAM. We make use of Bit Error Ratio (BER) as performance measure. BER vs SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) curves provide comparison between the non linear effects caused by Gain Compression in particular.
