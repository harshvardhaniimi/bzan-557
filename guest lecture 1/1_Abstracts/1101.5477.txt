On special elements in higher algebraic K-theory and the  Lichtenbaum-Gross Conjecture;;; David Burns,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Gangl_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Herbert Gangl</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Jeu_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Rob de Jeu</a> ;;; We conjecture the existence of special elements in odd degree higher algebraic K-groups of number fields that are related in a precise way to the values at strictly negative integers of the derivatives of Artin L-functions of finite dimensional complex representations. We prove this conjecture in certain important cases and also provide other evidence (both theoretical and numerical) in its support.
