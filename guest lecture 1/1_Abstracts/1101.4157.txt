Extended Derdzinski-Shen theorem for the Riemann tensor;;; Carlo Alberto Mantica,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Molinari_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Luca Guido Molinari</a> ;;; We extend a classical result by Derdzinski and Shen, on the restrictions imposed on the Riemann tensor by the existence of a nontrivial Codazzi tensor. The new conditions of the theorem include Codazzi tensors (i.e. closed 1-forms) as well as tensors with gauged Codazzi condition (i.e. "recurrent 1-forms"), typical of some well known differential structures.
