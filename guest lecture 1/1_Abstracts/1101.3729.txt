We work with variable sound speeds that might be also discontinuous across some surface. The latter problem arises in brain imaging. The new algorithm is based on an explicit formula in the form of a Neumann series. We present numerical examples with non-trapping, trapping and piecewise smooth speeds, as well as examples with data on a part of the boundary. These numerical examples demonstrate the robust performance of the new algorithm.
