The Riemann zeta in terms of the dilogarithm;;; Sergio Albeverio,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Cacciapuoti_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Claudio Cacciapuoti</a> ;;; We give a representation of the classical Riemann $\zeta$-function in terms of a Mellin transform involving the real part of the dilogarithm function with an argument on the unit circle (associated Clausen $Gl_2$-function). We also derive corresponding representations involving the derivatives of the $Gl_2$-function. As corollaries we derive new proofs of zero-free regions for the $\zeta$-function and of bounds on it. A generalized symmetrized M\"untz-type formula is derived. For a special choice of test functions it gives a new derivation of the functional equation and provides a computation of a Mellin transform. Certain formulas involving series of zeta functions are also derived.
