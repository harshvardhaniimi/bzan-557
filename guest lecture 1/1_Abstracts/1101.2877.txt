Weak coupling limits in a stochastic model of heat conduction;;; Frank Redig,,  <a href="/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Vafayi_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Kiamars Vafayi</a> ;;; We study the Brownian momentum process, a model of heat conduction, weakly coupled to heat baths. In two different settings of weak coupling to the heat baths, we study the non-equilibrium steady state and its proximity to the local equilibrium measure in terms of the strength of coupling. For three and four site systems, we obtain the two-point correlation function and show it is generically not multilinear.
