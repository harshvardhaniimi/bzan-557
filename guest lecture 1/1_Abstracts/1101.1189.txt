Simulated avalanche formation around streamers in an overvolted air gap;;; Chao Li,,  <a href="/find/physics/1/au:+Ebert_U/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ute Ebert</a>,  <a href="/find/physics/1/au:+Hundsdorfer_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">Willem Hundsdorfer</a> ;;; We simulate streamers in air at standard temperature and pressure in a short overvolted gap. The simulation is performed with a 3D hybrid model that traces the single electrons and photons in the low density region, while modeling the streamer interior as a fluid. The photons are followed by a Monte-Carlo procedure, just like the electrons. The first simulation result is present here.
