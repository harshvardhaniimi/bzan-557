Eulerian-Catalan Numbers;;; Hoda Bidkhori,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sullivant_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Seth Sullivant</a> ;;; We show that the Eulerian-Catalan numbers enumerate Dyck permutations. We provide two proofs for this fact, the first using the geometry of alcoved polytopes and the second a direct combinatorial proof via an Eulerian-Catalan analogue of the Chung-Feller theorem.
