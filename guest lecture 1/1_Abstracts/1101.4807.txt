Role of operator semirings in characterizing $\Gamma$-semirings in terms  of fuzzy subsets;;; Sujit Kumar Sardar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Jun_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Y. B. Jun</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Goswami_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sarbani Goswami</a> ;;; The operator semirings of a $\Gamma$-semiring have been brought into use to study $\Gamma$-semiring in terms of fuzzy subsets. This is accomplished by obtaining various relationships between the set of all fuzzy ideals of a $\Gamma$-semiring and the set of all fuzzy ideals of its left operator semiring such as lattice isomorphism between the sets of fuzzy ideals of a $\Gamma$-semiring and its operator semirings.
