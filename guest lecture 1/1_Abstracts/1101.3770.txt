Quilted Floer trajectories with constant components;;; Katrin Wehrheim,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Woodward_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Chris T. Woodward</a> ;;; We fill a gap in the proof of the transversality result for quilted Floer trajectories in <a href="/abs/0905.1370">arXiv:0905.1370</a> by addressing trajectories for which some but not all components are constant. Namely we show that for generic sets of split Hamiltonian perturbations and split almost complex structures, the moduli spaces of parametrized quilted Floer trajectories of a given index are smooth of expected dimension. An additional benefit of the generic split Hamiltonian perturbations is that they perturb the given cyclic Lagrangian correspondence such that any geometric composition of its factors is transverse and hence immersed.
