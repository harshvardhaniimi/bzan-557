Statistical systems of particles with scalar interaction in cosmology;;; Yu.G. Ignatyev,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Miftakhov_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">R.F. Miftakhov</a> ;;; Cosmological solutions of the equations with scalar interaction are being studied. It is shown, that the scalar field can effectively change the equation of state of statistical system, that leads to series of cosmological consequences.
