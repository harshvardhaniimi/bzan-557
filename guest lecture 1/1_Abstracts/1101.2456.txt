Polynomial Representations of General Linear Groups and  Categorifications of Fock Space;;; Jiuzu Hong,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Yacobi_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Oded Yacobi</a> ;;; We study a limit category $M$ constructed from the polynomial representations of all general linear groups. We construct a $g$-categorification on $M$ in the sense of Chuang and Rouquier, which categorifies the Fock space representation of $g$, (here $g$ is either $\hat{sl}_p$ or $sl_{\infty}$ depending on the characteristic of the ground field). As an application, we construct the Misra-Miwa crystal of Fock space from the set of simple objects of $M$.
