Cohomology with coefficients in stacks of Picard categories;;; Mamuka Jibladze,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pirashvili_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Teimuraz Pirashvili</a> ;;; Cohomology of a topological space with coefficients in stacks of abelian 2-groups is considered. A 2-categorical analog of the theorem of Grothendieck is proved, relating cohomology of the space with coefficients in a 2-stage spectrum and the Ext groups of appropriate stacks.
