Tangential Extremal Principles for Finite and Infinite Systems of Sets,  II: Applications to Semi-infinite and Multiobjective Optimization;;; Boris S. Mordukhovich,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Phan_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hung M. Phan</a> ;;; This paper contains selected applications of the new tangential extremal principles and related results developed in Part I to calculus rules for infinite intersections of sets and optimality conditions for problems of semi-infinite programming and multiobjective optimization with countable constraints
