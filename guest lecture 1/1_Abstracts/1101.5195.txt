A New Condition for the Invariance Principle for Stationary Random  Fields;;; Yizao Wang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Woodroofe_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Michael Woodroofe</a> ;;; We establish a central limit theorem and an invariance principle for stationary random fields, with projective-type conditions. Our result is obtained via an m-dependent approximation method. As applications, we establish invariance principles for orthomartingales and functionals of linear random fields.
