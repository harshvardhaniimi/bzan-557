On quantum stochastic differential equations;;; J. Martin Lindsay,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Skalski_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Adam G. Skalski</a> ;;; Existence and uniqueness theorems for quantum stochastic differential equations with nontrivial initial conditions are proved for coefficients with completely bounded columns. Applications are given for the case of finite-dimensional initial space or, more generally, for coefficients satisfying a finite localisability condition. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for a conjugate pair of quantum stochastic cocycles on a finite-dimensional operator space to strongly satisfy such a quantum stochastic differential equation. This gives an alternative approach to quantum stochastic convolution cocycles on a coalgebra.
