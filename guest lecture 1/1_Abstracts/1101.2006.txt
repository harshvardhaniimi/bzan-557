On approximating two distributions from a single complex-valued function;;; W.D. Flanders,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Japaridze_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">G. Japaridze</a> ;;; We consider the problem of approximating two, possibly unrelated probability distributions from a single complex-valued function $\psi$ and its Fourier transform. We show that this problem always has a solution within a specified degree of accuracy, provided the distributions satisfy the necessary regularity conditions. We describe the algorithm and construction of $\psi$ and provide examples of approximating several pairs of distributions using the algorithm.
