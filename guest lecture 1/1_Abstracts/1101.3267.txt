N-fold integer programming in cubic time;;; Raymond Hemmecke,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Onn_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Shmuel Onn</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Romanchuk_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Lyubov Romanchuk</a> ;;; N-fold integer programming is a fundamental problem with a variety of natural applications in operations research and statistics. Moreover, it is universal and provides a new, variable-dimension, parametrization of all of integer programming. The fastest algorithm for $n$-fold integer programming predating the present article runs in time $O\left(n^{g(A)}L\right)$ with $L$ the binary length of the numerical part of the input and $g(A)$ the so-called Graver complexity of the bimatrix $A$ defining the system. In this article we provide a drastic improvement and establish an algorithm which runs in time $O\left(n^3 L\right)$ having cubic dependency on $n$ regardless of the bimatrix $A$. Our algorithm can be extended to separable convex piecewise affine objectives as well, and also to systems defined by bimatrices with variable entries. Moreover, it can be used to define a hierarchy of approximations for any integer programming problem.
