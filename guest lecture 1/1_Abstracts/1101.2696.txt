On the $L_p$-error of approximation of bivariate functions by harmonic  splines;;; Yuliya Babenko,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Leskevich_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tatyana Leskevich</a> ;;; Interpolation by various types of splines is the standard procedure in many applications. In this paper we shall discuss harmonic spline "interpolation" (on the lines of a grid) as an alternative to polynomial spline interpolation (at vertices of a grid). We will discuss some advantages and drawbacks of this approach and present the asymptotics of the $L_p$-error for adaptive approximation by harmonic splines.
