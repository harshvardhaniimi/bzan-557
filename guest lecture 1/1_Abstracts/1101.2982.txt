Multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials and the six-vertex model;;; Martin Bender,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Delvaux_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Steven Delvaux</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kuijlaars_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Arno B.J. Kuijlaars</a> ;;; We study multiple orthogonal polynomials of Meixner-Pollaczek type with respect to a symmetric system of two orthogonality measures. Our main result is that the limiting distribution of the zeros of these polynomials is one component of the solution to a constrained vector equilibrium problem. We also provide a Rodrigues formula and closed expressions for the recurrence coefficients. The proof of the main result follows from a connection with the eigenvalues of block Toeplitz matrices, for which we provide some general results of independent interest. The motivation for this paper is the study of a model in statistical mechanics, the so-called six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions, in a particular regime known as the free fermion line. We show how the multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials arise in an inhomogeneous version of this model.
