A note on the geometric simplicity of the spectral radius of nonnegative  irreducible tensors;;; Yuning Yang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Yang_Q/0/1/0/all/0/1">Qingzhi Yang</a> ;;; We prove that the spectral radius of even order nonnegative irreducible tensors is real geometrically simple. In the case when the order of the tensor is odd, or in the complex field, some conditions are given to guarantee the geometric simplicity of the spectral radius.
