Maximal $L^p$-regularity for stochastic evolution equations;;; Jan van Neerven,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Veraar_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mark Veraar</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Weis_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Lutz Weis</a> ;;; We prove maximal $L^p$-regularity for the stochastic evolution equation \[\{{aligned} dU(t) + A U(t)\, dt&amp; = F(t,U(t))\,dt + B(t,U(t))\,dW_H(t), \qquad t\in [0,T], <br />U(0) &amp; = u_0, {aligned}.\] under the assumption that $A$ is a sectorial operator with a bounded $H^\infty$-calculus of angle less than $\frac12\pi$ on a space $L^q(\mathcal{O},\mu)$. The driving process $W_H$ is a cylindrical Brownian motion in an abstract Hilbert space $H$. For $p\in (2,\infty)$ and $q\in [2,\infty)$ and initial conditions $u_0$ in the real interpolation space $\XAp $ we prove existence of unique strong solution with trajectories in \[L^p(0,T;\Dom(A))\cap C([0,T];\XAp),\] provided the non-linearities $F:[0,T]\times \Dom(A)\to L^q(\mathcal{O},\mu)$ and $B:[0,T]\times \Dom(A) \to \g(H,\Dom(A^{\frac12}))$ are of linear growth and Lipschitz continuous in their second variables with small enough Lipschitz constants. Extensions to the case where $A$ is an adapted operator-valued process are considered as well. <br />Various applications to stochastic partial differential equations are worked out in detail. These include higher-order and time-dependent parabolic equations and the Navier-Stokes equation on a smooth bounded domain $\OO\subseteq \R^d$ with $d\ge 2$. For the latter, the existence of a unique strong local solution with values in $(H^{1,q}(\OO))^d$ is shown.
