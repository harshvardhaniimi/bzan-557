Galilean Conformal and Superconformal Symmetries;;; Jerzy Lukierski, (Inst. for Theor. Phys., Wroclaw University) ;;; Firstly we discuss briefly three different algebras named as nonrelativistic (NR) conformal: Schroedinger, Galilean conformal and infinite algebra of local NR conformal isometries. Further we shall consider in some detail Galilean conformal algebra (GCA) obtained in the limit c equal to infinity from relativistic conformal algebra O(d+1,2) (d - number of space dimensions). Two different contraction limits providing GCA and some recently considered realizations will be briefly discussed. Finally by considering NR contraction of D=4 superconformal algebra the Galilei conformal superalgebra (GCSA) is obtained, in the formulation using complex Weyl supercharges.
