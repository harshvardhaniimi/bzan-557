Regularity for the optimal transportation problem with Euclidean  distance squared cost on the embedded sphere;;; Jun Kitagawa,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Warren_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Micah Warren</a> ;;; We give sufficient conditions on initial and target measures supported on the sphere $\S^n$ to ensure the solution to the optimal transport problem with the cost $|x-y|^2/2$ is a diffeomorphism.
