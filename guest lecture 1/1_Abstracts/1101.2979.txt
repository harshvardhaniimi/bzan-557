Unbounded Laplacians on Graphs: Basic Spectral Properties and the Heat  Equation;;; Matthias Keller,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lenz_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Daniel Lenz</a> ;;; We discuss Laplacians on graphs in a framework of regular Dirichlet forms. We focus on phenomena related to unboundedness of the Laplacians. This includes (failure of) essential selfadjointness, absence of essential spectrum and stochastic incompleteness.
