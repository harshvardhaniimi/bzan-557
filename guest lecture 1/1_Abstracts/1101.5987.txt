Branes, Quantization and Fuzzy Spheres;;; Christian Saemann,,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Szabo_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Richard J. Szabo</a> ;;; We propose generalized quantization axioms for Nambu-Poisson manifolds, which allow for a geometric interpretation of n-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras. We illustrate these axioms by describing extensions of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization to produce various examples of quantum spaces of relevance to the dynamics of M-branes, such as fuzzy spheres in diverse dimensions. We briefly describe preliminary steps towards making the notion of quantized 2-plectic manifolds rigorous by extending the groupoid approach to quantization of symplectic manifolds.
