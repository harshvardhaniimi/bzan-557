Convergence Analysis of a Class of Massively Parallel Direction  Splitting Algorithms for the Navier-Stokes Equations;;; Jean-Luc Guermond,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Minev_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Peter D. Minev</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Salgado_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Abner J. Salgado</a> ;;; We provide a convergence analysis for a new fractional time-stepping technique for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on direction splitting. This new technique is of linear complexity, unconditionally stable and convergent, and suitable for massive parallelization.
