Logarithmic Sobolev Trace Inequalities;;; F. Feo,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Posteraro_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">M.R. Posteraro</a> ;;; We prove a logarithmic Sobolev trace inequality in a gaussian space and we study the trace operator in the weighted Sobolev space W^{1,p}(\Omega,\gamma) for sufficiently regular domain. We exhibit examples to show the sharpness of the results. Applications to PDE are also considered.
