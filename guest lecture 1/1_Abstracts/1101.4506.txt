On the integral homology of PSL4(Z) and other arithmetic groups;;; Mathieu Dutour Sikiric,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ellis_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Graham Ellis</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Schuermann_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Achill Schuermann</a> ;;; We determine the integral homology of PSL4(Z) in degrees at most 5 and determine its p-part in higher degrees for the primes p&gt;=5. Our method applies to other arithmetic groups; as illustrations we include descriptions of the integral homology of PGL3(Z[i]) and PGL3(Z[\exp(2\pi{i}/3)]) in degrees at most 5.
