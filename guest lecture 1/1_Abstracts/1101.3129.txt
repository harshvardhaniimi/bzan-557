The Dirac-Hardy and Dirac-Sobolev inequalities in $L^1$;;; A. A. Balinsky,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Evans_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">W. D. Evans</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Umeda_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T. Umeda</a> ;;; Dirac-Sobolev and Dirac-Hardy inequalities in $L^1$ are established in which the $L^p$ spaces which feature in the classical Sobolev and Hardy inequalities are replaced by weak $L^p$ spaces. Counter examples to the analogues of the classical inequalities are shown to be provided by zero modes for appropriate Pauli operators constructed by Loss and Yau.
