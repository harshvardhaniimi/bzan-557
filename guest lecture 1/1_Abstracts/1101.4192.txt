Holomorphic Cartan geometry on manifolds with numerically effective  tangent bundle;;; Indranil Biswas,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Bruzzo_U/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ugo Bruzzo</a> ;;; Let X be a compact connected Kaehler manifold such that the holomorphic tangent bundle TX is numerically effective. A theorem of Demailly, Peternell and Schenider says that there is a finite unramified Galois covering M --&gt; X, a complex torus T, and a holomorphic surjective submersion f: M --&gt; T, such that the fibers of f are Fano manifolds with numerically effective tangent bundle. A conjecture of Campana and Peternell says that the fibers of f are rational and homogeneous. Assume that X admits a holomorphic Cartan geometry. We prove that the fibers of f are rational homogeneous varieties. We also prove that the holomorphic principal G-bundle over T given by f, where G is the group of all holomorphic automorphisms of a fiber, admits a flat holomorphic connection.
