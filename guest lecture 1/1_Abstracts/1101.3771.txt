Truncated Toeplitz operators and boundary values in nearly invariant  subspaces;;; Andreas Hartmann, (IMB),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ross_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">William T. Ross</a> ;;; We consider truncated Toeplitz operator on nearly invariant subspaces of the Hardy space $H^2$. Of some importance in this context is the boundary behavior of the functions in these spaces which we will discuss in some detail.
