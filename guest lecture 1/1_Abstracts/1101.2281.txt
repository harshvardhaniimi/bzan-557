$j$-multiplicity and depth of associated graded modules;;; Claudia Polini,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xie_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yu Xie</a> ;;; Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring. We define the minimal $j$-multiplicity and almost minimal $j$-multiplicity of an arbitrary $R$-ideal on any finite $R$-module. For any ideal $I$ with minimal $j$-multiplicity or almost minimal $j$-multiplicity on a Cohen-Macaulay module $M$, we prove that under some residual assumptions, the associated graded module ${\rm gr}_I(M)$ is Cohen-Macaulay or almost Cohen-Macaulay, respectively. Our work generalizes the results for minimal multiplicity and almost minimal multiplicity obtained by Sally, Rossi, Valla, Wang, Huckaba, Elias, Corso, Polini, and VazPinto.
