Snake representation of a superprocess in random environment;;; Leonid Mytnik,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xiong_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jie Xiong</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zeitouni_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ofer Zeitouni</a> ;;; We consider (discrete time) branching particles in a random environment which is i.i.d. in time and possibly spatially correlated. We prove a representation of the limit process by means of a Brownian snake in random environment.
