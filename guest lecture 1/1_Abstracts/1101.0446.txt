Alternative approach to the optimality of the threshold strategy for  spectrally negative Levy processes;;; Chuancun Yin,,  <a href="/find/q-fin/1/au:+Shen_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ying Shen</a>,  <a href="/find/q-fin/1/au:+Yuen_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Kam Chuen Yuen</a> ;;; Consider the optimal dividend problem for an insurance company whose uncontrolled surplus precess evolves as a spectrally negative Levy process. We assume that dividends are paid to the shareholders according to admissible strategies whose dividend rate is bounded by a constant. The objective is to find a dividend policy so as to maximize the expected discounted value of dividends which are paid to the shareholders until the company is ruined. Kyprianou, Loeffen and Perez [28] have shown that a refraction strategy (also called threshold strategy) forms an optimal strategy under the condition that the Levy measure has a completely monotone density. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to this optimal problem.
