Taxicab Angles and Trigonometry;;; Kevin Thompson,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Dray_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tevian Dray</a> ;;; A natural analogue to angles and trigonometry is developed in taxicab geometry. This structure is then analyzed to see which, if any, congruent triangle relations hold. A nice application involving the use of parallax to determine the exact (taxicab) distance to an object is also discussed.
