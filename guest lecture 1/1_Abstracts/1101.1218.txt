Uniformly stable rectangular elements for fourth order elliptic singular  perturbation problems;;; Li Wang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xie_X/0/1/0/all/0/1">Xiaoping Xie</a> ;;; This paper analyzes rectangular finite element methods for fourth order elliptic singular perturbation problems. We show that the non-$C^0$ rectangular Morley element is uniformly convergent in the energy norm with respect to the perturbation parameter. We also propose a $C^0$ extended high order rectangular Morley element and prove the uniform convergence. Finally, we do some numerical experiments to confirm the theoretical results.
