Weak solutions to the continuous coagulation equation with multiple  fragmentation;;; Ankik Kumar Giri,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Laurencot_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Philippe Laurencot</a> (IMT),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Warnecke_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Gerald Warnecke</a> ;;; The existence of weak solutions to the continuous coagulation equation with multiple fragmentation is shown for a class of unbounded coagulation and fragmentation kernels, the fragmentation kernel having possibly a singularity at the origin. This result extends previous ones where either boundedness of the coagulation kernel or no singularity at the origin for the fragmentation kernel were assumed.
