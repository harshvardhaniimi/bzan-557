Another Proof of the Existence a Dedekind Complete Totally Ordered Field;;; James F. Hall,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Todorov_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Todor D. Todorov</a> ;;; We describe the Dedekind cuts explicitly in terms of non-standard rational numbers. This leads to another construction of a Dedekind complete totally ordered field or, equivalently, to another proof of the consistency of the axioms of the real numbers. We believe that our construction is simpler and shorter than the classical Dedekind construction and Cantor construction of such fields assuming some basic familiarity with non-standard analysis.
