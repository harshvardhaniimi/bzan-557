Stable Poisson Graphs in One Dimension;;; Maria Deijfen,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Holroyd_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alexander E. Holroyd</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Peres_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yuval Peres</a> ;;; Let each point of a homogeneous Poisson process on $\RR$ independently be equipped with a random number of stubs (half-edges) according to a given probability distribution $\mu$ on the positive integers. We consider schemes based on Gale-Shapley stable marriage for perfectly matching the stubs to obtain a simple graph with degree distribution $\mu$. We prove results on the existence of an infinite component and on the length of the edges, with focus on the case $\mu(\{2\})=1$. In this case, for the random direction stable matching scheme introduced by Deijfen and Meester we prove that there is no infinite component, while for the stable matching of Deijfen, H\"aggstr\"om and Holroyd we prove that existence of an infinite component follows from a certain statement involving a {\em finite} interval, which is overwhelmingly supported by simulation evidence.
