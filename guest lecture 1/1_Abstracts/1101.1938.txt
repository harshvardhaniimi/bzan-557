An inductive analytic criterion for flatness;;; Janusz Adamus,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Bierstone_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Edward Bierstone</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Milman_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Pierre D. Milman</a> ;;; We present a constructive criterion for flatness of a morphism of analytic spaces X -&gt; Y or, more generally, for flatness over Y of a coherent sheaf of modules on X. The criterion is a combination of a simple linear-algebra condition "in codimension zero" and a condition "in codimension one" which can be used together with the Weierstrass preparation theorem to inductively reduce the fibre dimension of the morphism.
