Let $\Phi_n$ denote the $n$-th cyclotomic polynomial and let $\Psi_n$ denote the $n$-th inverse cyclotomic polynomial. In this note, we study $g(\Phi_n)$ and $g(\Psi_n)$ where $n$ is a product of odd primes, say $p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; p_3$, etc. It is trivial to determine $g(\Phi_{p_1})$, $g(\Psi_{p_1})$ and $g(\Psi_{p_1p_2})$. Hence the simplest non-trivial cases are $g(\Phi_{p_1p_2})$ and $g(\Psi_{p_1p_2p_3})$. We provide an exact expression for $g(\Phi_{p_1p_2}).$ We also provide an exact expression for $g(\Psi_{p_1p_2p_3})$ under a mild condition. The condition is almost always satisfied (only finite exceptions for each $p_1$). We also provide a lower bound and an upper bound for $g(\Psi_{p_1p_2p_3})$.
