No-go theorems for functorial localic spectra of noncommutative rings;;; Benno van den Berg,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Heunen_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Chris Heunen</a> ;;; Any functor from the category of C*-algebras to the category of locales which assigns to each commutative C*-algebra its Gelfand spectrum must be trivial on algebras of n-by-n matrices for n&gt;=3. The same obstruction applies to the Zariski, Stone, and Pierce spectra. The possibility of spectra in categories other than that of locales is briefly discussed.
