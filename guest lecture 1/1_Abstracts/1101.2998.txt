Logarithmic convexity of integral means for analytic functions;;; Chunjie Wang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zhu_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Kehe Zhu</a> ;;; We show that the $L^2$ integral mean on $r\D$ of an analytic function in the unit disk $\D$ with respect to the weighted area measure $(1-|z|^2)^\alpha\,dA(z)$, where $-3\le\alpha\le0$, is a logarithmically convex function of $r$ on $(0,1)$. We also show that the range $[-3,0]$ for $\alpha$ is best possible.
