Lagrangian angles of family of Lagrangian fibrations under mean  curvature flow;;; John Man-shun Ma,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wan_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tom Yau-heng Wan</a> ;;; In this paper, we discuss the Lagrangian angles of a family of Lagrangian fibrations moved under mean curvature flow. In the case $n=1$, the angle function is shown to satisfy a degenerated partial differential equation. We prove that any smooth solution to the equation also corresponds to smooth foliation of curves under mean curvature flow.
