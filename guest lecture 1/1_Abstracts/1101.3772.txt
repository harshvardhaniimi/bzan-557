Parking garages with optimal dynamics;;; Meital Cohen,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Weiss_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Barak Weiss</a> ;;; We construct generalized polygons (`parking garages') in which the billiard flow satisfies the Veech dichotomy, although the associated translation surface obtained from the Zemlyakov-Katok unfolding is not a lattice surface. We also explain the difficulties in constructing a genuine polygon with these properties.
