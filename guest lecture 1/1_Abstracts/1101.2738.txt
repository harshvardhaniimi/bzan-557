Geometric interpretation of Murphy bases and an application;;; Uri Onn,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Singla_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Pooja Singla</a> ;;; In this article we study the representations of general linear groups which arise from their action on flag spaces. These representations can be decomposed into irreducibles by proving that the associated Hecke algebra is cellular. We give a geometric interpretation of a cellular basis of such Hecke algebras which was introduced by Murphy in the case of finite fields. We apply these results to decompose representations which arise from the space of modules over principal ideal local rings of length two with a finite residue field.
