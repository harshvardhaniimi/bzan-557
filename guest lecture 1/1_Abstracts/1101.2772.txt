On K3 fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds;;; Elena Andreini,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Martinez_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Cristina Martinez</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Todorov_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Andrey Todorov</a> ;;; Given X a K3 surface, a mirror dual to X can be identified with a component of the moduli space of semistable sheaves on X. We consider fibrations by K3 surfaces over a one dimensional base that are Calabi-Yau and we obtain a dual fibration that turns to be derived equivalent to the original one and we relate the problem to mirror symmetry.
