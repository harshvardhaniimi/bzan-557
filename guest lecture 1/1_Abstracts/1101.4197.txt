Principal parts of operators in the dbar-Neumann problem on strictly  pseudoconvex non-smooth domains;;; Dariush Ehsani,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lieb_I/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ingo Lieb</a> ;;; Our main goal is to describe the integral kernel of the dbar-Neumann operator on certain non-smooth domains, the so-called Henkin-Leiterer domains. We do so by explicitly constructing an integral kernel which accounts for the main mapping properties of the operator. We use our calculations to derive $L^p$ estimates.
