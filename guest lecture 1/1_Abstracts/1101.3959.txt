Asymptotics of a vanishing period : the quotient themes of a given  fresco;;; Daniel Barlet, (IECN, IUF) ;;; In this paper we introduce the word "fresco" to denote a $[\lambda]-$primitive monogenic geometric (a,b)-module. The study of this "basic object" (generalized Brieskorn module with one generator) which corresponds to the minimal filtered (regular) differential equation satisfied by a relative de Rham cohomology class, began in [B.09] where the first structure theorems are proved. Then in [B.10] we introduced the notion of theme which corresponds in the $[\lambda]-$primitive case to frescos having a unique Jordan-H{\"o}lder sequence. Themes correspond to asymptotic expansion of a given vanishing period, so to the image of a fresco in the module of asymptotic expansions. For a fixed relative de Rham cohomology class (for instance given by a smooth differential form $d-$closed and $df-$closed) each choice of a vanishing cycle in the spectral eigenspace of the monodromy for the eigenvalue $exp(-2i\pi.\lambda)$ produces a $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, which is a quotient of the fresco associated to the given relative de Rham class itself. So the problem to determine which theme is a quotient of a given fresco is important to deduce possible asymptotic expansions of the various vanishing period integrals associated to a given relative de Rham class when we change the choice of the vanishing cycle. In the appendix we prove a general existence result which naturally associate a fresco to any relative de Rham cohomology class of a proper holomorphic function of a complex manifold onto a disc.
