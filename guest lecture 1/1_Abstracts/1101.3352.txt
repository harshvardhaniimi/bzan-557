Dimensional behaviour of entropy and information;;; Sergey Bobkov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Madiman_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mokshay Madiman</a> ;;; We develop an information-theoretic perspective on some questions in convex geometry, providing for instance a new equipartition property for log-concave probability measures, some Gaussian comparison results for log-concave measures, an entropic formulation of the hyperplane conjecture, and a new reverse entropy power inequality for log-concave measures analogous to V. Milman's reverse Brunn-Minkowski inequality.
