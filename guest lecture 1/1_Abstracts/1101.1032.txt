Change-point in stochastic design regression and the bootstrap;;; Emilio Seijo,,  <a href="/find/math,stat/1/au:+Sen_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Bodhisattva Sen</a> ;;; In this paper we study the consistency of different bootstrap procedures for constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for the unique jump discontinuity (change-point) in an otherwise smooth regression function in a stochastic design setting. This problem exhibits nonstandard asymptotics and we argue that the standard bootstrap procedures in regression fail to provide valid confidence intervals for the change-point. We propose a version of smoothed bootstrap, illustrate its remarkable finite sample performance in our simulation study, and prove the consistency of the procedure. The $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap procedure is also considered and shown to be consistent. We also provide sufficient conditions for any bootstrap procedure to be consistent in this scenario.
