A note on the hybrid steepest descent methods;;; Koji Aoyama,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kimura_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yasunori Kimura</a> ;;; The aim of this paper is to prove that, in an appropriate setting, every iterative sequence generated by the hybrid steepest descent method is convergent whenever so is every iterative sequence generated by the Halpern type iterative method.
