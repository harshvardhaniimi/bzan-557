Tilted Sperner Families;;; Imre Leader,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Long_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Eoin Long</a> ;;; Let \cal A be a family of subsets of an n-set such that \cal A does not contain distinct sets A and B with |A\B| = 2|B\A|. How large can \cal A be? Our aim in this note is to determine the maximum size of such an \cal A. This answers a question of Kalai. We also give some related results and conjectures.
