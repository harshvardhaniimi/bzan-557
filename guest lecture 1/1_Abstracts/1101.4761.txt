On the Stability of a Chain of Phase Oscillators;;; Jan Sieber,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kalmar_Nagy_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tamas Kalmar-Nagy</a> ;;; We study a chain of $N+1$ phase oscillators with asymmetric but uniform coupling. This type of chain possesses $2^{N}$ ways to synchronize in so-called travelling wave states, i.e. states where the phases of the single oscillators are in relative equilibrium. We show that the number of unstable dimensions of a travelling wave equals the number of oscillators with relative phase close to $\pi$. This implies that only the relative equilibrium corresponding to approximate in-phase synchronization is locally stable. Despite the presence of a Lyapunov-type functional periodic or chaotic phase slipping occurs. For chains of length 3 and 4 we locate the region in parameter space where rotations (corresponding to phase slipping) are present.
