Dynamic model of spherical perturbations in the Friedmann universe. II.  retarding solutions for the ultrarelativistic equation of state;;; Yu.G. Ignatyev,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Elmakhi_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">N. Elmakhi</a> ;;; Exact linear retarding spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein equations linearized around Friedmann background for the ultrarelativistic equation of state are obtained and investigated. Uniqueness of the solutions in the $C^{1} $ class is proved.
