Study of Gamma Semigroups via its Operator Semigroups in terms of  Atanassov&#x27;s Intuitionistic Fuzzy Ideals;;; Sujit Kumar Sardar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Majumder_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Samit Kumar Majumder</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mandal_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Manasi Mandal</a> ;;; In this paper some fundamental relationships of a gamma semigroup and its operator semigroups in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy subsets, intuitionistic fuzzy ideals, intuitionistic fuzzy prime(semiprime) ideals, intuitionistic fuzzy ideal extensions are obtained. These are then used to obtain some important characterization theorems of gamma semigroups in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy subsets so as to highlight the role of operator semigroups in the study of gamma semigroups in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy subsets.
