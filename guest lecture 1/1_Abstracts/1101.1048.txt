Topological, smooth and holomorphic classifications of nonautonomous  linear differential systems and projective matrix Riccati equations;;; V.N. Gorbuzov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tyshchenko_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">V.Yu. Tyshchenko</a> ;;; The questions of global topological, smooth and holomorphic classifications of the differential systems, defined by covering foliations, are considered. The received results are applied to nonautonomous linear differential systems and projective matrix Riccati equations.
