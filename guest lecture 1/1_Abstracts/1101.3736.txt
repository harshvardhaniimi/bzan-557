On tropical dualities in cluster algebras;;; Tomoki Nakanishi,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zelevinsky_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Andrei Zelevinsky</a> ;;; We study two families of integer vectors playing a crucial part in the structural theory of cluster algebras: the $\gg$-vectors parameterizing cluster variables, and the $\cc$-vectors parameterizing the coefficients. We prove two identities relating these vectors to each other. The proofs depend on the sign-coherence assumption for $\cc$-vectors that still remains unproved in full generality.
