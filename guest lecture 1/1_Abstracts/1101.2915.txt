Robust exponential decay of correlations for singular-flows;;; Vitor Araujo,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Varandas_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Paulo Varandas</a> ;;; We construct open sets of Ck (k bigger or equal to 2) vector fields with singularities that have robust exponential decay of correlations with respect to the unique physical measure. In particular we prove that the geometric Lorenz attractor has exponential decay of correlations with respect to the unique physical measure.
