Friedel-Type Oscillations in the Problem of Skin Effect in Degenerate  Collisionless Plasma;;; A.V. Latyshev,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Yushkanov_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A.A.Yushkanov</a> ;;; It is shown that a Friedel type oscillations accompany skin effect in degenerate plasma of a metal. It was learnt earlier that Friedel oscillations take place under charge screening in quantum plasma. However the nature of Friedel oscillations is not in the quantum character of the plasma, but in the features of degenerate Fermi distribution, namely, in its sharp transformation into zero directly just the other side of the Fermi surface. This circumstance leads to the Frieldel-type oscillations under anomalous skin effect.
