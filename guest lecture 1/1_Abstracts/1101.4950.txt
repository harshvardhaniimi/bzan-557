Arc Spaces and Rogers-Ramanujan Identities;;; Clemens Bruschek,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mourtada_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hussein Mourtada</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Schepers_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jan Schepers</a> ;;; Arc spaces have been introduced in algebraic geometry as a tool to study singularities but they show strong connections with combinatorics as well. Exploiting these relations we obtain a new approach to the classical Rogers-Ramanujan Identities. The linking object is the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of the arc space over a point of the base variety. In the case of the double point this is precisely the generating series for the integer partitions without equal or consecutive parts.
