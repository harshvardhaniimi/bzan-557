A posteriori error estimators suitable for moving finite element methods  under anisotropic meshes;;; Xiaobo Yin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xie_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hehu Xie</a> ;;; In this paper, we give a new type of a posteriori error estimators suitable for moving finite element methods under anisotropic meshes for general second-order elliptic problems. The computation of estimators is simple once corresponding Hessian matrix is recovered. Wonderful efficiency indices are shown in numerical experiments.
