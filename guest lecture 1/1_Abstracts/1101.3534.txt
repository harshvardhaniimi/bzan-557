On D.Y. Gao and R.W. Ogden&#x27;s paper &quot;Multiple solutions to non-convex  variational problems with implications for phase transitions and numerical  computation&quot;;;; M.D. Voisei,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zalinescu_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">C. Zalinescu</a> ;;; In this note we prove that a recent result stated by D.Y. Gao and R.W. Ogden on global minimizers and local extrema in a phase transition problem is false. Our goal is achieved by providing a thorough analysis of the context and result in question and counter-examples.
