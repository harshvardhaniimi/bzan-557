Scattering for the focusing energy-subcritical NLS;;; Daoyuan Fang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xie_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jian Xie</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Cazenave_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Thierry Cazenave</a> ;;; For the 3D focusing cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, Scattering of $H^1$ solutions inside the (scale invariant) potential well was established by Holmer and Roudenko~\cite{HR2} (radial case) and Duyckaerts, Holmer and Roudenko~\cite{DHR} (general case). In this paper, we extend this result to arbitrary space dimensions and focusing, mass-supercritical and energy-subcritical power nonlinearities, by adapting the method of~\cite{DHR}.
