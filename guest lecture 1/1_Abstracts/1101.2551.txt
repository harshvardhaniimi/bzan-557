Reduction of invariant constrained systems using anholonomic frames;;; M. Crampin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mestdag_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T. Mestdag</a> ;;; We analyze two reduction methods for nonholonomic systems that are invariant under the action of a Lie group on the configuration space. Our approach for obtaining the reduced equations is entirely based on the observation that the dynamics can be represented by a second-order differential equations vector field and that in both cases the reduced dynamics can be described by expressing that vector field in terms of an appropriately chosen anholonomic frame.
