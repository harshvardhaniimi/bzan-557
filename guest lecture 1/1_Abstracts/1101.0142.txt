Asymptotic Improvements of Lower Bounds for the Least Common Multiples  of Arithmetic Progressions;;; Daniel M. Kane,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kominers_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Scott D. Kominers</a> ;;; For relatively prime positive integers $u_0$ and $r$, we consider the least common multiple $L_n := lcm(u_0, u_1, ..., u_n)$ of the finite arithmetic progression $u_k := u_0+kr$ ($k = 0, ..., n$). We derive new lower bounds on $L_n$ which improve upon those obtained previously when either $u_0$ or $n$ is large. When $r$ is prime, our best bound is sharp up to a factor of $n+1$ for $u_0$ properly chosen, and is also nearly sharp as $n$ grows large.
