On representation of an integer as the sum of three squares and the  ternary quadratic forms with the discriminants p^2, 16p^2;;; Alexander Berkovich,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Jagy_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">Will Jagy</a> ;;; Let s(n) be the number of representations of n as the sum of three squares. We prove a remarkable new identity for s(p^2n)- ps(n) with p being an odd prime. This identity makes nontrivial use of ternary quadratic forms with discriminants p^2 and 16p^2. These forms are related by Watson's transformations. To prove this identity we employ the Siegel--Weil and the Smith--Minkowski product formulas.
