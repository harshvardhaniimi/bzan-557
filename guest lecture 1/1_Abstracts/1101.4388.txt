Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces with the l1 Norm;;; Guohui Song,,  <a href="/find/stat/1/au:+Zhang_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Haizhang Zhang</a>,  <a href="/find/stat/1/au:+Hickernell_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Fred J. Hickernell</a> ;;; Targeting at sparse learning, we construct Banach spaces B of functions on an input space X with the properties that (1) B possesses an l1 norm in the sense that it is isometrically isomorphic to the Banach space of integrable functions on X with respect to the counting measure; (2) point evaluations are continuous linear functionals on B and are representable through a bilinear form with a kernel function; (3) regularized learning schemes on B satisfy the linear representer theorem. Examples of kernel functions admissible for the construction of such spaces are given.
