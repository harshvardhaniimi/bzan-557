The Geometry of Flex Tangents to a Cubic Curve and its Parameterizations;;; Jean-Marc Couveignes,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kammerer_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jean-Gabriel Kammerer</a> ;;; We show how the study of the geometry of the nine flex tangents to a cubic produces pseudo-parameterizations, including the ones given by Icart, Kammerer, Lercier, Renault and Farashahi, and infinitely many new ones.
