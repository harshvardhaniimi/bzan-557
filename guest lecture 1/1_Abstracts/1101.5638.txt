Lower Bound for Convex Hull Area and Universal Cover Problems;;; Tirasan Khandhawit,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pagonakis_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dimitrios Pagonakis</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sriswasdi_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sira Sriswasdi</a> ;;; In this paper, we provide a lower bound for an area of the convex hull of points and a rectangle in a plane. We then apply this estimate to establish a lower bound for a universal cover problem. We showed that a convex universal cover for a unit length curve has area at least 0.232239. In addition, we show that a convex universal cover for a unit closed curve has area at least 0.0879873.
