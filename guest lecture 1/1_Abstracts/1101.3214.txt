Generalized Belief Propagation for the Noiseless Capacity and  Information Rates of Run-Length Limited Constraints;;; Giovanni Sabato,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Molkaraie_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mehdi Molkaraie</a> ;;; The performance of the generalized belief propagation algorithm for computing the noiseless capacity and mutual information rates of finite-size two-dimensional and three-dimensional run-length limited constraints is investigated. For each constraint, a method is proposed to choose the basic regions and to construct the region graph. Simulation results for the capacity of different constraints as a function of the size of the channel and mutual information rates of different constraints as a function of signal-to-noise ratio are reported. Convergence to the Shannon capacity is also discussed.
