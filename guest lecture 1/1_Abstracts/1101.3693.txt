Locally conformally Kaehler structures on homogeneous spaces;;; Keizo Hasegawa,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kamishima_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yoshinobu Kamishima</a> ;;; We show as a main result a structure theorem of compact homogeneous locally conformal Kaehler (or shortly l.c.K.) manifolds, asserting that it has a structure of holomorphic fiber bundle over a flag manifold with fiber a 1-dimensional complex torus. We also discuss compact locally homogeneous l.c.K. manifolds; and classify all complex surfaces admitting homogeneous and locally homogeneous l.c.K. structures.
