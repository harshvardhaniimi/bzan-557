Cayley graphs of order 27p are hamiltonian;;; Ebrahim Ghaderpour,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Morris_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dave Witte Morris</a> ;;; Suppose G is a finite group, such that |G| = 27p, where p is prime. We show that if S is any generating set of G, then there is a hamiltonian cycle in the corresponding Cayley graph Cay(G;S).
