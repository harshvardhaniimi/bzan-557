A generalized nonlinear Schr&#xf6;dinger equation as model for turbulence,  collapse, and inverse cascade;;; Dian Zhao,,  <a href="/find/physics/1/au:+Yu_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">M. Y. Yu</a> ;;; A two-dimensional generalized cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with complex coefficients for the group dispersion and nonlinear terms is used to investigate the evolution of a finite-amplitude localized initial perturbation. It is found that modulation of the latter can lead to side-band formation, wave condensation, collapse, turbulence, and inverse cascade, although not all together nor in that order.
