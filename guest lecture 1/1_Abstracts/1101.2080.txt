Transferring curved $A_{\infty}$-structures and Chern classes;;; Nikolay M. Nikolov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zahariev_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Svetoslav Zahariev</a> ;;; We discuss how curved $A_{\infty}$- and $L_{\infty}$-algebras arise as deformations of $A_{\infty}$- and $L_{\infty}$-algebras and how the former structures can be transferred along chain contractions using homological perturbation theory. As an application, given vector bundle on a polyhedron $X$, we exhibit a curved $A_{\infty}$-structure on the complex of matrix-valued cochains of sufficiently fine triangulations of $X$. We use this structure as a motivation to develop a non-assosiative version of Chern-Weil theory.
