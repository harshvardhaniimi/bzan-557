Structure constants of diagonal reduction algebras of gl type;;; S. Khoroshkin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ogievetsky_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">O. Ogievetsky</a> ;;; We describe, in terms of generators and relations, the reduction algebra, related to the diagonal embedding of the Lie algebra $\gl_n$ into $\gl_n\oplus\gl_n$. Its representation theory is related to the theory of decompositions of tensor products of $\gl_n$-modules.
