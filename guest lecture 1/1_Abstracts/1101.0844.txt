Long-time and large-distance asymptotic behavior of the current-current  correlators in the non-linear Schr&#xf6;dinger model;;; K. K. Kozlowski,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Terras_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">V. Terras</a> ;;; We present a new method allowing us to derive the long-time and large-distance asymptotic behavior of the correlations functions of quantum integrable models from their exact representations. Starting from the form factor expansion of the correlation functions in finite volume, we explain how to reduce the complexity of the computation in the so-called interacting integrable models to the one appearing in free fermion equivalent models. We apply our method to the time-dependent zero-temperature current-current correlation function in the non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger model and compute the first few terms in its asymptotic expansion. Our result goes beyond the conformal field theory based predictions: in the time-dependent case, other types of excitations than the ones on the Fermi surface contribute to the leading orders of the asymptotics.
