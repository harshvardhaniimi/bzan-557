Numerical Schemes for Multivalued Backward Stochastic Differential  Systems;;; Lucian Maticiuc,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Rotenstein_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Eduard Rotenstein</a> ;;; We define some approximation schemes for different kinds of generalized backward stochastic differential systems, considered in the Markovian framework. We propose a mixed approximation scheme for a decoupled system of forward reflected SDE and backward stochastic variational inequality. We use an Euler scheme type, combined with Yosida approximation techniques.
