Formulas and Asymptotics for the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process;;; Craig A. Tracy,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Widom_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Harold Widom</a> ;;; This is an expanded version of a series of lectures delivered by the second author in June, 2009. It describes the results of three of the authors' papers on ASEP, from the derivation of exact formulas for configuration probabilities, through Fredholm determinant representation, to asymptotics for ASEP with step initial condition establishing KPZ universality. Although complete proofs are in general not given, at least the main elements of them are.
