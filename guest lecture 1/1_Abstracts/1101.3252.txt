Yet another proof of Marstrand&#x27;s Theorem;;; Yuri Lima,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Moreira_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Carlos Gustavo Moreira</a> ;;; In a paper from 1954 Marstrand proved that if K is a Borel subset of the plane with Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, then its one-dimensional projection has positive Lebesgue measure for almost-all directions. In this article, we give a new proof of this theorem, extending the techniques developed in a previous work.
