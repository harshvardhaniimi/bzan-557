Steiner Ratio for Manifolds;;; D. Cieslik,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ivanov_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A.O. Ivanov</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tuzhilin_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A.A. Tuzhilin</a> ;;; The Steiner ratio characterizes the greatest possible deviation of the length of a minimal spanning tree from the length of the minimal Steiner tree. In this paper, estimates of the Steiner ratio on Riemannian manifolds are obtained. As a corollary, the Steiner ratio for flat tori, flat Klein bottles, and projective plane of constant positive curvature are computed.
