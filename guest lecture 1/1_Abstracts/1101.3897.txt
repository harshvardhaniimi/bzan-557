Commutativity conditions for truncated Brown-Peterson spectra of height  2;;; Tyler Lawson,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Naumann_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">Niko Naumann</a> ;;; An algebraic criterion, in terms of closure under power operations, is determined for the existence and uniqueness of generalized trun- cated Brown-Peterson spectra of height 2 as E_\infty-ring spectra. The criterion is checked for an example at the prime 2 derived from the universal elliptic curve equipped with a level \Gamma_1(3)-structure.
