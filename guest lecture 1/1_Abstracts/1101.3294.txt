Finiteness of the EPRL/FK spin foam model;;; Aleksandar Mikovic,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Vojinovic_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Marko Vojinovic</a> ;;; We show that the EPRL/FK spin foam model of quantum gravity can be made finite by dividing the vertex amplitude with an appropriate power $p$ of the product of dimensions of the vertex spins. This power is independent of the spin foam 2-complex and we find a lower bound for $p$ which makes the state sum absolutely convergent.
