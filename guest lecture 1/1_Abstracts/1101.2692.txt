Minimal pseudo-Anosov translation lengths on the complex of curves;;; Vaibhav Gadre,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tsai_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Chia-Yen Tsai</a> ;;; We establish bounds on the minimal asymptotic pseudo-Anosov translation lengths on the complex of curves of orientable surfaces. In particular, for a closed surface with genus $g \geqslant 2$, we show that there are positive constants $a_1 &lt; a_2$ such that the minimal translation length is bounded below and above by $a_1/ g^2$ and $a_2/g^2$.
