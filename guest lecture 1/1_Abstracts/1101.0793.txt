New Two-Dimensional Quantum Models with Shape Invariance;;; F. Cannata,,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Ioffe_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">M.V. Ioffe</a>,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Nishnianidze_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">D.N. Nishnianidze</a> ;;; Two-dimensional quantum models which obey the property of shape invariance are built in the framework of polynomial two-dimensional SUSY Quantum Mechanics. They are obtained using the expressions for known one-dimensional shape invariant potentials. The constructed Hamiltonians are integrable with symmetry operators of fourth order in momenta, and they are not amenable to the conventional separation of variables.
