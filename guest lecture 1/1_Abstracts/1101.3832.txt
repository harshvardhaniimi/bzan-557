On power deformations of univalent functions;;; Yong Chan Kim,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sugawa_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Toshiyuki Sugawa</a> ;;; For an analytic function $f(z)$ on the unit disk $|z|&lt;1$ with $f(0)=f'(0)-1=0$ and $f(z)\ne0, 0&lt;|z|&lt;1,$ we consider the power deformation $f_c(z)=z(f(z)/z)^c$ for a complex number $c.$ We determine those values $c$ for which the operator $f\mapsto f_c$ maps a specified class of univalent functions into the class of univalent functions. A little surprisingly, we will see that the set is described by the variability region of the quantity $zf'(z)/f(z),~|z|&lt;1,$ for the class in most cases which we consider in the present paper. As an unexpected by-product, we show boundedness of strongly spirallike functions.
