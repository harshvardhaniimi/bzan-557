On fuzzy h-ideals in h-regular $\Gamma$-hemiring and h-duo  $\Gamma$-hemiring;;; S. K. Sardar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mandal_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">D. Mandal</a> ;;; In this paper, fuzzy h-bi-ideals, fuzzy h-quasi-ideals and fuzzy h-interior ideals of a $\Gamma$-hemiring are studied and some related properties are investi- gated. The notions of h-intra-hemiregularity and h-quasi-hemiregularity of a $\Gamma$-hemiring are introduced and studied along with h-hemiregularity and their characterizations in terms of fuzzy h-ideals are also obtained. The concept of fuzzy h-duo $\Gamma$-hemiring is introduced and some of its characterizations are obtained.
