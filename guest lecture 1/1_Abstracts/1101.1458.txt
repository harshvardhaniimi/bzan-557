Nonnegative minors of minor matrices;;; David A. Cardon,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Nielsen_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Pace P. Nielsen</a> ;;; Using the relationship between totally nonnegative matrices and directed acyclic weighted planar networks, we show that $2\times 2$ minors of minor matrices of totally nonnegative matrices are also nonnegative. We give a combinatorial interpretation for the minors of minor matrices in terms of the weights of families of paths in a network.
