Essential self-adjointness, generalized eigenforms, and spectra for the  $\bar\partial$-Neumann problem on $G$-manifolds;;; Joe J. Perez,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Stollmann_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Peter Stollmann</a> ;;; Let $M$ be a strongly pseudoconvex complex manifold which is also the total space of a principal $G$-bundle with $G$ a Lie group and compact orbit space $\bar M/G$. Here we investigate the $\bar\partial$-Neumann Laplacian on $M$. We show that it is essentially self-adjoint on its restriction to compactly supported smooth forms. Moreover we relate its spectrum to the existence of generalized eigenforms: an energy belongs to $\sigma(\square)$ if there is a subexponentially bounded generalized eigenform for this energy. Vice versa, there is an expansion in terms of these well-behaved eigenforms so that, spectrally, almost every energy comes with such a generalized eigenform.
