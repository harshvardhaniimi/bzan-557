Parameter estimation for alpha-fractional bridges;;; Khalifa Es-Sebaiy, (IMB),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Nourdin_I/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ivan Nourdin</a> (IECN) ;;; Let alpha,T&gt;0. We study the asymptotic properties of a least squares estimator for the parameter alpha of a fractional bridge defined as dX_t=-alpha*X_t/(T-t)dt+dB_t, with t in [0,T) and where B is a fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index H&gt;1/2. Depending on the value of alpha, we prove that we may have strong consistency or not as t tends to T. When we have consistency, we obtain the rate of this convergence as well. Also, we compare our results to the (known) case where B is replaced by a standard Brownian motion W.
