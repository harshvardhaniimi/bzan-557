On chirotopes of finite planar families of pairwise disjoint convex  bodies;;; Luc Habert,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pocchiola_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Michel Pocchiola</a> ;;; We extend the classical characterization of chirotopes of finite planar families of points---which says that a map \chi\ defined on the set of triples of a finite indexing set I is the chirotope of a finite planar family of points if and only if for every 3-, 4-, and 5-subset J of I the restriction of \chi\ to the set of triples of J is the chirotope of a finite planar family of points---to chirotopes of finite planar families of pairwise disjoint convex bodies. Our main tool is the polarity map, i.e., the map that assigns to a convex body the set of lines missing its interior, from which we derive the key notion of arrangements of double pseudolines, introduced for the first time in this paper.
