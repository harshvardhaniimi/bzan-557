On the speed of convergence to stationarity via spectral gap: queueing  networks with breakdowns and repairs;;; Pawel Lorek,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Szekli_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ryszard Szekli</a> ;;; We show that for unreliable Jackson networks spectral gap is strictly positive iff the spectral gaps for the corresponding coordinate birth and death processes are positive. Moreover, positivity of these spectral gaps is equivalent to the condition that for the stationary distribution of the network each of the one dimensional marginal distributions is strongly light-tailed, that is its discrete hazard function is separated from zero. Consequently, we obtain exponential ergodicity of unreliable networks iff for the corresponding stationary distribution the strong light-tailness condition holds. Connecting marginal distributions with the corresponding service rate functions, we characterize exponential rate of convergence in terms of the service rate functions.
