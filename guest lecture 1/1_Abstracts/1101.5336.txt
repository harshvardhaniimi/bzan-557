On the existence of a (2,3)-spread in V(7,2);;; Olof Heden,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sissokho_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Papa A. Sissokho</a> ;;; An $(s,t)$-spread in a finite vector space $V=V(n,q)$ is a collection $\mathcal F$ of $t$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ with the property that every $s$-dimensional subspace of $V$ is contained in exactly one member of $\mathcal F$. It is remarkable that no $(s,t)$-spreads has been found yet, except in the case $s=1$. In this note, the concept $\alpha$-point to a $(2,3)$-spread $\mathcal F$ in {$V=V(7,2)$} is introduced. A classical result of Thomas, applied to the vector space $V$, states that all points of $V$ cannot be $\alpha$-points to a given $(2,3)$-spread $\mathcal F$ in $V$. {In this note, we strengthened this result by proving that} every 6-dimensional subspace of $V$ must contain at least one point that is not an $\alpha$-point to a given $(2,3)$-spread of $V$.
