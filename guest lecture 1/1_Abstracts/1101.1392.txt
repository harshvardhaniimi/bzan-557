The abelianization of the Johnson kernel;;; Alexandru Dimca,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Hain_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Richard Hain</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Papadima_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Stefan Papadima</a> ;;; We prove that the first complex homology of the Johnson subgroup of the Torelli group $T_g$ is a non-trivial unipotent $T_g$-module for all $g\ge 4$ and give an explicit presentation of it as a $\Sym H_1(T_g,\C)$-module when $g\ge 6$. We do this by proving that, for a finitely generated group $G$ satisfying an assumption close to formality, the triviality of the restricted characteristic variety implies that the first homology of its Johnson kernel $K$ is a nilpotent module over the corresponding Laurent polynomial ring, isomorphic to the infinitesimal Alexander invariant of the associated graded Lie algebra of $G$. In this setup, we also obtain a precise nilpotence test.
