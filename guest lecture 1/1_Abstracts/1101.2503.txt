On the Order of the Schur Multiplier of a Pair of Finite p-Groups;;; Azam Hokmabadi,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mohammadzadeh_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Fahimeh Mohammadzadeh</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mashayekhy_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Behrooz Mashayekhy</a> ;;; In 1997, G. Ellis defined the Schur multiplier of a pair (G,N) of groups and mentioned that this notion is a useful tool for studying pairs of groups. In this paper we characterize the structure of a pair of finite p-groups (G,N) in terms of the order of the Schur multiplier of (G,N) under some conditions.
