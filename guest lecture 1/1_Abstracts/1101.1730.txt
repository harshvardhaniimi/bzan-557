On the generalised Tate conjecture for products of elliptic curves over  finite fields;;; Bruno Kahn, (IMJ) ;;; We prove the generalised Tate conjecture for H^3 of products of elliptic curves over finite fields, by slightly modifying an argument of M. Spiess concerning the Tate conjecture. We prove it fully if the elliptic curves run among at most 3 isogeny classes. We also show how things become more intricate from H^4 onwards, for more that 3 isogeny classes.
