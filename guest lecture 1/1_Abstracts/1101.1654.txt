Exact solution of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations in the  background of a plane gravitational wave with combined polarization;;; A.A. Agathonov,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Ignatyev_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yu.G. Ignatyev</a> ;;; We obtain an exact solution of the self-consistent relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations for an anisotropic magnetoactive plasma in the background of a plane gravitational wave metric (PGW) with an arbitrary polarization. It is shown that, in the linear approximation in the gravitational wave amplitude, only the $\mathbf{e_+}$ polarization of the PGW interacts with a magnetoactive plasma.
