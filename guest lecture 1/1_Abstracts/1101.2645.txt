Classical limit of the d-bar operators on quantum domains;;; Slawomir Klimek,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+McBride_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Matt McBride</a> ;;; We study one parameter families $D_t$, $0&lt;t&lt;1$ of non-commutative analogs of the d-bar operator $D_0 = \frac{\d}{\d\bar{z}}$ on disks and annuli in complex plane and show that, under suitable conditions, they converge in the classical limit to their commutative counterpart. More precisely, we endow the corresponding families of Hilbert spaces with the structures of continuous fields over the interval $[0,1)$ and we show that the inverses of the operators $D_t$ subject to APS boundary conditions form morphisms of those continuous fields of Hilbert spaces.
