Cluster structures on simple complex Lie groups and the Belavin-Drinfeld  classification;;; Michael Gekhtman,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Shapiro_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Michael Shapiro</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Vainshtein_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alek Vainshtein</a> ;;; We study natural cluster structures in the rings of regular functions on simple complex Lie groups and Poisson-Lie structures compatible with these cluster structures. According to our main conjecture, each class in the Belavin-Drinfeld classification of Poisson-Lie structures on $\G$ corresponds to a cluster structure in $\O(\G)$. We prove a reduction theorem explaining how different parts of the conjecture are related to each other. The conjecture is established for $SL_n$, $n&lt;5$, and for any $\G$ in the case of the standard Poisson-Lie structure.
