Qualitative behavior of solutions for thermodynamically consistent  Stefan problems with surface tension;;; Jan Pruess,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Simonett_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Gieri Simonett</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zacher_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Rico Zacher</a> ;;; The qualitative behavior of a thermodynamically consistent two-phase Stefan problem with surface tension and with or without kinetic undercooling is studied. It is shown that these problems generate local semiflows in well-defined state manifolds. If a solution does not exhibit singularities in a sense made precise below, it is proved that it exists globally in time and its orbit is relatively compact. In addition, stability and instability of equilibria is studied. In particular, it is shown that multiple spheres of the same radius are unstable, reminiscent of the onset of Ostwald ripening.
