Wireless Peer-to-Peer Mutual Broadcast via Sparse Recovery;;; Lei Zhang,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Guo_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dongning Guo</a> ;;; Consider a problem frequently seen in wireless peer-to-peer networks: Every node has messages to broadcast to its peers, namely, all nodes within one hop. Conventional schemes allow only one transmission to succeed at a time in a two-hop neighborhood, because 1) simultaneous transmissions in the neighborhood collide, and 2) affordable radio is half-duplex and cannot simultaneously transmit and receive useful signals. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for the peer-to-peer mutual broadcast problem, which exploits the multiaccess nature of the wireless medium and addresses the half-duplex constraint at the fundamental level. The defining feature of the scheme is to let all nodes send their messages at the same time, where each node broadcasts a codeword (selected from its unique codebook) consisting of on-slots and off-slots, where it transmits only during its on-slots, and listens to its peers through its own off-slots. Each node decodes the messages of its peers based on the received superposed signals through its own off-slots. Decoding can be viewed as a problem of sparse support recovery based on linear measurements (with erasures). In case each message consists of a small number of bits, an iterative message-passing algorithm based on belief propagation is developed, the performance of which is characterized using a state evolution formula in the limit where each node has a large number of peers. Numerical results demonstrate that the message-passing algorithm outperforms popular compressed sensing algorithms such as CoSaMP and AMP. Furthermore, to achieve the same reliability for peer-to-peer broadcast, the proposed scheme achieves three to five times the rate of ALOHA and carrier-sensing multiple-access (CSMA) in typical scenarios.
