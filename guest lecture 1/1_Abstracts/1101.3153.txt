The Cartan form for constrained Lagrangian systems and the nonholonomic  Noether theorem;;; M. Crampin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mestdag_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T. Mestdag</a> ;;; This paper deals with conservation laws for mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. It uses a Lagrangian formulation of nonholonomic systems and a Cartan form approach. We present what we believe to be the most general relations between symmetries and first integrals. We discuss the so-called nonholonomic Noether theorem in terms of our formalism, and we give applications to Riemannian submanifolds, to Lagrangians of mechanical type, and to the determination of quadratic first integrals.
