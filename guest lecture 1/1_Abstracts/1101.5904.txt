Fractional $h$-difference equations arising from the calculus of  variations;;; Rui A. C. Ferreira,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Torres_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Delfim F. M. Torres</a> ;;; The recent theory of fractional $h$-difference equations introduced in [N. R. O. Bastos, R. A. C. Ferreira, D. F. M. Torres: Discrete-time fractional variational problems, Signal Process. 91 (2011), no. 3, 513--524], is enriched with useful tools for the explicit solution of discrete equations involving left and right fractional difference operators. New results for the right fractional $h$ sum are proved. Illustrative examples show the effectiveness of the obtained results in solving fractional discrete Euler-Lagrange equations.
