On the Riemann surface type of Random Planar Maps;;; James T. Gill,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Rohde_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Steffen Rohde</a> ;;; We show that the (random) Riemann surfaces of the Angel-Schramm Uniform Infinite Planar Triangulation and of Sheffield's infinite necklace construction are both parabolic. In other words, Brownian motion on these surfaces is recurrent. We obtain this result as a corollary to a more general theorem on subsequential distributional limits of random unbiased disc triangulations, following work of Benjamini and Schramm.
