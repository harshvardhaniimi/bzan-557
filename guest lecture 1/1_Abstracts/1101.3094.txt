Stability Criteria for Linear Hamiltonian Systems Under Impulsive  Perturbations;;; Zeynep Kayar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zafer_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Agacik Zafer</a> ;;; Stability criteria are given for linear periodic Hamiltonian systems with impulse effect. A Lyapunov type inequality and a disconjugacy criterion are also established. The results improve the ones in the literature for such systems.
