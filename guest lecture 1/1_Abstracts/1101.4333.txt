Peeling of Dirac and Maxwell fields on a Schwarzschild background;;; Lionel Mason,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Nicolas_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jean-Philippe Nicolas</a> ;;; We study the peeling of Dirac and Maxwell fields on a Schwarzschild background following the approach developed by the authors in Mason-Nicolas 2009 for the wave equation. The method combines a conformal compactification with vector field techniques in order to work out the optimal space of initial data for a given transverse regularity of the rescaled field across null infinity. The results show that analogous decay and regularity assumptions in Minkowski and in Schwarzschild produce the same regularity across null infinity. The results are valid also for the classes of asymptotically simple spacetimes constructed by Corvino-Schoen / Chrusciel-Delay.
