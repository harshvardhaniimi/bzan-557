On the scaling limits of planar percolation;;; Stanislav Smirnov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Schramm_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Oded Schramm</a> ;;; We prove Tsirelson's conjecture that any scaling limit of the critical planar percolation is a black noise. Our theorems apply to a number of percolation models, including site percolation on the triangular grid and any subsequential scaling limit of bond percolation on the square grid. We also suggest a natural construction for the scaling limit of planar percolation, and more generally of any discrete planar model describing connectivity properties.
