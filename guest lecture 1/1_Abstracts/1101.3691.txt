Reconstructing the nucleon-nucleon potential by a new coupled-channel  inversion method;;; Andrey Pupasov,,  <a href="/find/nucl-th/1/au:+Samsonov_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Boris F. Samsonov</a>,  <a href="/find/nucl-th/1/au:+Sparenberg_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jean-Marc Sparenberg</a>,  <a href="/find/nucl-th/1/au:+Baye_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Daniel Baye</a> ;;; A second-order supersymmetric transformation is presented, for the two-channel Schr\"odinger equation with equal thresholds. It adds a Breit-Wigner term to the mixing parameter, without modifying the eigenphase shifts, and modifies the potential matrix analytically. The iteration of a few such transformations allows a precise fit of realistic mixing parameters in terms of a Pade expansion of both the scattering matrix and the effective-range function. The method is applied to build an exactly-solvable potential for the neutron-proton $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ case.
