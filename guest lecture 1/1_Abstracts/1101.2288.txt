On the Degree of Freedom for Multi-Source Multi-Destination Wireless  Network with Multi-layer Relays;;; Feng Liu,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Chan_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Chung Chan</a>,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Jun_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ying Jun</a> (Angela) <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Zhang/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zhang</a> ;;; Degree of freedom (DoF) region provides an approximation of capacity region in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while sum DoF gives the scaling factor. In this correspondence, we analyse the DoF region and sum DoF for unicast layered multi-hop relay wireless networks with arbitrary number of source/destination/relay nodes, arbitrary number of hops and arbitrary number of antennas at each node. The result is valid for quite a few message topologies. We reveal the limitation on capacity of multi-hop network due to the concatenation structure and show the similarity with capacitor network. From the analysis on bound gap and optimality condition, the ultimate capacity of multi-hop network is shown to be strictly inferior to that of single-hop network. Linear scaling law can be established when the number of hops is fixed. At cost of channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) for each component single-hop network, our achievable scheme avoids routing and simplifies scheduling.
