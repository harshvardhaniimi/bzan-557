Variation and oscillation for singular integrals with odd kernel on  Lipschitz graphs;;; Albert Mas,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tolsa_X/0/1/0/all/0/1">Xavier Tolsa</a> ;;; We prove that, for r&gt;2, the r-variation and oscillation for the smooth truncations of the Cauchy transform on Lipschitz graphs are bounded in L^p for 1&lt;p finite. The analogous result holds for the n-dimensional Riesz transform on n-dimensional Lipschitz graphs, as well as for other singular integral operators with odd kernel. In particular, our results strengthen the classical theorem on the L^2 boundedness of the Cauchy transform on Lipschitz graphs by Coifman, McIntosh, and Meyer.
