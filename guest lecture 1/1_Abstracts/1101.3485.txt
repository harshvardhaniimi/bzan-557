In this paper, we develop the framework for model reduction of large-scale multi-input/multi-output port-Hamiltonian systems via tangential rational interpolation. The resulting reduced-order model not only is a rational tangential interpolant but also retains the port-Hamiltonian structure; hence is passive. This reduction methodology is described in both energy and co-energy system coordinates. We also introduce an $\mathcal{H}_2$-inspired algorithm for effectively choosing the interpolation points and tangential directions. The algorithm leads a reduced port-Hamiltonian model that satisfies a subset of $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimality conditions. We present several numerical examples that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method showing that it outperforms other existing techniques in both quality and numerical efficiency.
