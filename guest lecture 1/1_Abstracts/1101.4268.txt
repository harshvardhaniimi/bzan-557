The Proof of Alzer&#x27;s Conjecture on Generalized Logarithmic Mean;;; Hongwei Lou,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Liu_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dongdi Liu</a> ;;; In 1987, Alzer posed a conjecture on generalized logarithmic mean, which was introduced by Stolarsky in 1975. To prove Alzer's conjecture, Lou posed a conjecture on generalized inverse harmonic mean in 1995. By proving Lou's conjecture, the paper yields Alzer's conjecture finally.
