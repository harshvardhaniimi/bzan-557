Extension with growth estimates of holomorphic functions defined on  singular analytic spaces;;; William Alexandre,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mazzilli_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Emmanuel Mazzilli</a> ;;; Let D be a strictly convex domain and X be a singular analytic subset of C^2 such that the intersection of X and D is non empty. We give conditions under which a function holomophic on the intersection of X and D can be extended holomorphically to D with growth estimates of BMO or L^q type. The extension is given by mean of integral representation formulas and new residual currents.
