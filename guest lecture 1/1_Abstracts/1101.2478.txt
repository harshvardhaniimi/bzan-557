Delay and Power-Optimal Control in Multi-Class Queueing Systems;;; Chih-ping Li,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Neely_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Michael J. Neely</a> ;;; We consider optimizing average queueing delay and average power consumption in a nonpreemptive multi-class M/G/1 queue with dynamic power control that affects instantaneous service rates. Four problems are studied: (1) satisfying per-class average delay constraints; (2) minimizing a separable convex function of average delays subject to per-class delay constraints; (3) minimizing average power consumption subject to per-class delay constraints; (4) minimizing a separable convex function of average delays subject to an average power constraint. Combining an achievable region approach in queueing systems and the Lyapunov optimization theory suitable for optimizing dynamic systems with time average constraints, we propose a unified framework to solve the above problems. The solutions are variants of dynamic $c\mu$ rules, and implement weighted priority policies in every busy period, where weights are determined by past queueing delays in all job classes. Our solutions require limited statistical knowledge of arrivals and service times, and no statistical knowledge is needed in the first problem. Overall, we provide a new set of tools for stochastic optimization and control over multi-class queueing systems with time average constraints.
