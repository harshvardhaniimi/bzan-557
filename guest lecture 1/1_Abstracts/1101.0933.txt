Is a Brownian skew?;;; Antoine Lejay,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mordecki_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ernesto Mordecki</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Torres_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Soledad Torres</a> ;;; We study the asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to the observation of a trajectory of a Skew Brownian motion, through a uniform time discretization. We characterize the speed of convergence and the limiting distribution when the step size goes to zero, which in this case are non-classical, under the null hypothesis of the Skew Brownian motion being an usual Brownian motion. This allows to design a test on the skewness parameter. We show that numerical simulations that can be easily performed to estimate the skewness parameter, and provide an application in Biology.
