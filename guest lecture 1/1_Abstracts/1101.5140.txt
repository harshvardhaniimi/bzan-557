Hilbert functions of fat point subschemes of the plane: the two-fold way;;; A.V. Geramita,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Harbourne_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">B. Harbourne</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Migliore_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">J. Migliore</a> ;;; Two approaches for determining Hilbert functions of fat point subschemes of $\mathbb P^2$ are demonstrated. A complete determination of the Hilbert functions which occur for 9 double points is given using the first approach, extending results obtained in a previous paper using the second approach. In addition the second approach is used to obtain a complete determination of the Hilbert functions for $n\geq 9$ $m$-multiple points for every $m$ if the points are smooth points of an irreducible plane cubic curve. Additional results are obtained using the first approach for $n\geq 9$ double points when the points lie on an irreducible cubic (but now are not assumed to be smooth points of the cubic).
