Some remarks on absolutely summing multilinear operators;;; Adriano Thiago L. Bernardino,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pellegrino_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Daniel Pellegrino</a> ;;; This short note has a twofold purpose: (i) to solve the question that motivates a recent paper of D. Popa on multilinear variants of Pietsch's composition theorem for absolutely summing operators. More precisely, we remark that there is a natural perfect extension of Pietsch's composition theorem to the multilinear and polynomial settings. This fact was overlooked in the aforementioned paper; <br />(ii) to investigate extensions of some results of the aforementioned paper for particular situations, mainly by exploring cotype properties of the spaces involved.
