Hilbert space for quantum mechanics on superspace;;; Kevin Coulembier,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Bie_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hendrik De Bie</a> ;;; In superspace a realization of sl2 is generated by the super Laplace operator and the generalized norm squared. In this paper, an inner product on superspace for which this representation is skew-symmetric is considered. This inner product was already defined for spaces of weighted polynomials (see [K. Coulembier, H. De Bie and F. Sommen, Orthogonality of Hermite polynomials in superspace and Mehler type formulae, <a href="/abs/1002.1118">arXiv:1002.1118</a>]). In this article, it is proven that this inner product can be extended to the super Schwartz space, but not to the space of square integrable functions. Subsequently, the correct Hilbert space corresponding to this inner product is defined and studied. A complete basis of eigenfunctions for general orthosymplectically invariant quantum problems is constructed for this Hilbert space. Then the integrability of the sl2-representation is proven. Finally the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the super Fourier transform is constructed.
