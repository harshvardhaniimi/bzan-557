Sloane&#x27;s Gap. Mathematical and Social Factors Explain the Distribution  of Numbers in the OEIS;;; Nicolas Gauvrit,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Delahaye_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jean-Paul Delahaye</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zenil_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hector Zenil</a> ;;; The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is made up of thousands of numerical sequences considered particularly interesting by some mathematicians. The graphic representation of the frequency with which a number n as a function of n appears in that database shows that the underlying function decreases fast, and that the points are distributed in a cloud, seemingly split into two by a clear zone that will be referred to here as "Sloane's Gap". The decrease and general form are explained by mathematics, but an explanation of the gap requires further considerations.
