A simple algorithm for finding short sigma-definite representatives;;; Jean Fromentin, (LMPA),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Paris_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Luis Paris</a> (IMB) ;;; We describe a new algorithm which for each braid returns a quasi-geodesic sigma-definite word representative, defined as a braid word in which the generator sigma_i with maximal index i appears either only positively or only negatively.
