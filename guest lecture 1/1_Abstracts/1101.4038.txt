Boundary crossing Random Walks, clinical trials and multinomial  sequential estimation;;; Enrico Bibbona,,  <a href="/find/math,stat/1/au:+Rubba_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alessandro Rubba</a> ;;; A sufficient condition for the uniqueness of multinomial sequential unbiased estimators is provided generalizing a classical result for binomial samples. Unbiased estimators are applied to infer the parameters of multidimensional or multinomial Random Walks which are observed until they reach a boundary. An application to clinical trials is presented.
