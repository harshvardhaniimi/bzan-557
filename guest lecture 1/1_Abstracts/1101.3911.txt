Inequalities for eigenfunctions of the $p$-Laplacian;;; Barkat Ali Bhayo,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Vuorinen_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Matti Vuorinen</a> ;;; Motivated by the work of P. Lindqvist, we study eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional $p$-Laplace operator, the $\sin_p$ functions, and prove several inequalities for these and $p$-analogues of other trigonometric functions and their inverse functions. Similar inequalities are given also for the $p$-analogues of the hyperbolic functions and their inverses.
