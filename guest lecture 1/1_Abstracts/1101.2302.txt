Inverse spectral problems for Dirac operators on a finite interval;;; Ya. V. Mykytyuk,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Puyda_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">D. V. Puyda</a> ;;; We consider the direct and inverse spectral problems for Dirac operators that are generated by the differential expressions $$ \mathfrak t_q:=\frac{1}{i}\begin{pmatrix}I&amp;0 0&amp;-I\end{pmatrix}\frac{d}{dx}+\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;q q^*&amp;0\end{pmatrix} $$ and some separated boundary conditions. Here $q$ is an $r\times r$ matrix-valued function with entries belonging to $L_2((0,1),\mathbb C)$ and $I$ is the identity $r\times r$ matrix. We give a complete description of the spectral data (eigenvalues and suitably introduced norming matrices) for the operators under consideration and suggest an algorithm of reconstructing the potential $q$ from the corresponding spectral data.
