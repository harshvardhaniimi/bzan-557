Linked alternating forms and linked symplectic Grassmannians;;; Brian Osserman,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Bigas_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Montserrat Teixidor i Bigas</a> ;;; Motivated by applications to higher-rank Brill-Noether theory and the Bertram-Feinberg-Mukai conjecture, we introduce the concepts of linked alternating and linked symplectic forms on a chain of vector bundles, and show that the linked symplectic Grassmannians parametrizing chains of subbundles isotropic for a given linked symplectic form has good dimensional behavior analogous to that of the classical symplectic Grassmannian.
