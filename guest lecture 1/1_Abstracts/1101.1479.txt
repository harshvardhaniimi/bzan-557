Large deviations for the current and tagged particle in 1D  nearest-neighbor symmetric simple exclusion;;; Sunder Sethuraman,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Varadhan_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">S.R.S. Varadhan</a> ;;; Laws of large numbers, starting from certain nonequilibrium measures, have been shown for the integrated current across a bond, and a tagged particle in one dimensional symmetric nearest-neighbor simple exclusion (Jara-Landim (2006)). In this article, we prove corresponding large deviation principles, and evaluate the rate functions, showing different growth behaviors near and far from their zeroes which connect with results in Derrida-Gerschenfeld (2009).
