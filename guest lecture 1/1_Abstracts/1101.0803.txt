On W-algebra extensions of (2,p) minimal models: p &gt; 3;;; Drazen Adamovic,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Milas_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Antun Milas</a> ;;; This is a continuation of <a href="/abs/0908.4053">arXiv:0908.4053</a>, where, among other things, we classified irreducible representations of the triplet vertex algebra W_{2,3}. In this part we extend the classification to W_{2,p}, for all odd p&gt;3. We also determine the structure of the center of the Zhu algebra A(W_{2,p}) which implies the existence of a family of logarithmic modules having L(0)-nilpotent ranks 2 and 3. A logarithmic version of Macdonald-Morris constant term identity plays a key role in the paper.
