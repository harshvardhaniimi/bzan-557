Gelfand models and Robinson-Schensted correspondence;;; Fabrizio Caselli,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Fulci_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Roberta Fulci</a> ;;; In [F. Caselli, Involutory reflection groups and their models, J. Algebra 24 (2010), 370--393] there is constructed a uniform Gelfand model for all non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups which are involutory. Such model can be naturally decomposed into the direct sum of submodules indexed by $S_n$-conjugacy classes, and we present here a general result that relates the irreducible decomposition of these submodules with the projective Robinson-Schensted correspondence. This description also reflects in a very explicit way the existence of split representations for these groups.
