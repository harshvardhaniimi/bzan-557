Anderson localization for random magnetic Laplacian on Z^2;;; Laszlo Erdos,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Hasler_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">David Hasler</a> ;;; We consider a two dimensional magnetic Schroedinger operator on a square lattice with a spatially stationary random magnetic field. We prove Anderson localization near the spectral edges. We use a new approach to establish a Wegner estimate that does not rely on the monotonicity of the energy on the random parameters.
