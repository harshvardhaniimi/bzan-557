Quotient Cohomology for Tiling Spaces;;; Marcy Barge,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sadun_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Lorenzo Sadun</a> ;;; We define a relative version of tiling cohomology for the purpose of comparing the topology of tiling spaces when one is a factor of the other. We illustrate this with examples, and outline a method for computing the cohomology of tiling spaces of finite type.
