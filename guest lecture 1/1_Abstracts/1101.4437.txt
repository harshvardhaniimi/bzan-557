Ruin probabilities in tough times - Part 1 - Heavy-traffic approximation  for fractionally integrated random walks in the domain of attraction of a  nonGaussian stable distribution;;; Ph. Barbe, (CNRS),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+McCormick_W/0/1/0/all/0/1">W.P. McCormick</a> (UGA) ;;; Motivated by applications to insurance mathematics, we prove some heavy-traffic limit theorems for process which encompass the fractionally integrated random walk as well as some FARIMA processes, when the innovations are in the domain of attraction of a nonGaussian stable distribution.
