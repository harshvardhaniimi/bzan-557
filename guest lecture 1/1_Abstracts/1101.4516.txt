Soucek</a> ;;; Hermitean Clifford analysis is a higher dimensional function theory centered around the simultaneous null solutions, called Hermitean monogenic functions, of two Hermitean conjugate complex Dirac operators. As an essential step towards the construction of an orthogonal basis of Hermitean monogenic polynomials, in this paper a Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension theorem is established for such polynomials. The minimal number of initial polynomials needed to obtain a unique Hermitean monogenic extension is determined, along with the compatibility conditions they have to satisfy. The Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension principle then allows for a dimensional analysis of the spaces of spherical Hermitean monogenics, i.e. homogeneous Hermitean monogenic polynomials. A version of this extension theorem for specific real-analytic functions is also obtained.
