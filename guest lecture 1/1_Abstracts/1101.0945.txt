Abstract, Classic, and Explicit Turnpikes;;; Paolo Guasoni,,  <a href="/find/q-fin/1/au:+Kardaras_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Constantinos Kardaras</a>,  <a href="/find/q-fin/1/au:+Robertson_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Scott Robertson</a>,  <a href="/find/q-fin/1/au:+Xing_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hao Xing</a> ;;; Portfolio turnpikes state that, as the investment horizon increases, optimal portfolios for generic utilities converge to those of isoelastic utilities. This paper proves three kinds of turnpikes. In a general semimartingale setting, the abstract turnpike states that optimal final payoffs and portfolios converge under their myopic probabilities. In diffusion models with several assets and a single state variable, the classic turnpike demonstrates that optimal portfolios converge under the physical probability; meanwhile the explicit turnpike identifies the limit of finite-horizon optimal portfolios as a long-run myopic portfolio defined in terms of the solution of an ergodic HJB equation.
