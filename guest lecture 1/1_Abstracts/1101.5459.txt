Cesaro convergence of spherical averages for measure-preserving actions  of Markov semigroups and groups;;; Alexander Bufetov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Khristoforov_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mikhail Khristoforov</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Klimenko_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alexey Klimenko</a> ;;; Cesaro convergence of spherical averages is proven for measure-preserving actions of Markov semigroups and groups. Convergence in the mean is established for functions in $L^p$, $1\le p&lt;\infty$, and pointwise convergence for functions in $L^\infty$. In particular, for measure-preserving actions of word hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Gromov) we obtain Cesaro convergence of spherical averages with respect to any symmetric set of generators.
