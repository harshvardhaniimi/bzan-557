On an imaginary exponential functional of Brownian motion;;; D. Gredat,,  <a href="/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Dornic_I/0/1/0/all/0/1">I. Dornic</a>,  <a href="/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Luck_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">J.M. Luck</a> ;;; We investigate a random integral which provides a natural example of an imaginary exponential functional of Brownian motion. This functional shows up in the study of the binary annihilation process, within the Doi-Peliti formalism for reaction-diffusion systems. The main emphasis is put on the complementarity between the usual Langevin approach and another approach based on the similarity with Kesten variables and other one-dimensional disordered systems. Even though neither of these routes leads to the full solution of the problem, we have obtained a collection of results describing various regimes of interest.
