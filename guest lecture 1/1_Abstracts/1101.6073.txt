Thermodynamics of noncommutative BTZ black hole;;; Rashida Jahangir,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Saifullah_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">K. Saifullah</a> ;;; Thermodynamics of the BTZ black hole in noncommutative geometry is studied. We work out the Hawking temperature and entropy which reduce to their commutative limits when the noncommutativity parameter tends to zero. We also discuss the range of validity of the Hawking area law in the noncommutative case and provide graphical analysis. We see that the law is not valid unless the outer horizon is very large.
