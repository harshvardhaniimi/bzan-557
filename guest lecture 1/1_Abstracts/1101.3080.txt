Atanassov&#x27;s Intuitionistic Fuzzy Ideals of Gamma Semigroups;;; Sujit Kumar Sardar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Majumder_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Samit Kumar Majumder</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mandal_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Manasi Mandal</a> ;;; The notion of intuitionistic fuzzy set was introduced by Atanassov as a generalization of the notion of fuzzy set. In this paper we apply this concept of Atanassov to ideals, prime ideals and semiprime ideals of gamma semigroups in order to obtain some characterization theorems. We also introduce the notion of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy ideal extension in a gamma semigroup and investigate some of their important properties. A regular gamma semigroup has been characterized in terms of Atanasov's intutionistic fuzzy ideal. Characterization of prime ideal of a gamma semigroup has also been obtained in terms of Atanassov's intutionistic fuzzy ideal extension.
