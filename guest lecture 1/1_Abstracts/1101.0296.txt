A Graphical Approach to a Model of Neuronal Tree with Variable Diameter;;; Marco Herrera-Valdez,,  <a href="/find/q-bio/1/au:+Suslov_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sergei K. Suslov</a> ;;; We propose a simple graphical approach to steady state solutions of the cable equation for a general model of dendritic tree with tapering. A simple case of transient solutions is also briefly discussed.
