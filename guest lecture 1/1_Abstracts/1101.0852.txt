Ground State Entropy of the Potts Antiferromagnet on Homeomorphic  Expansions of Kagome Lattice Strips;;; Robert Shrock,,  <a href="/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Xu_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yan Xu</a> ;;; We present exact calculations of the chromatic polynomial and resultant ground state entropy of the $q$-state Potts antiferromagnet on lattice strips that are homeomorphic expansions of a strip of the kagome lattice. The dependence of the ground state entropy on the form of homeomorphic expansion is elucidated.
