On globally Symmetric Finsler spaces;;; R. Chavosh Khatamy,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Esmaili_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">R .Esmaili</a> ;;; The paper consider the symmetric of Finsler spaces. We give some conditions about globally symmetric Finsler spaces. Then we prove that these spaces can be written as a coset space of Lie group with an invariant Finsler metric. Finally, we prove that such a space must be Berwaldian
