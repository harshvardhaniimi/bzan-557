A Gap Theorem for Self-shrinkers of the Mean Curvature Flow in Arbitrary  Codimension;;; Huai-Dong Cao,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Li_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Haizhong Li</a> ;;; In this paper, we prove a classification theorem for self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow with $|A|^2\le 1$ in arbitrary codimension. In particular, this implies a gap theorem for self-shrinkers in arbitrary codimension.
