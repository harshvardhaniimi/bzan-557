Singularity of the extremal solution for supercritical biharmonic  equations with power-type nonlinearity;;; Baishun Lai,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Yan_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zhengxiang Yan</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zhang_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yinghui Zhang</a> ;;; Let $\lambda^{*}&gt;0$ denote the largest possible value of $\lambda$ such that $$ \{{array}{lllllll} \Delta^{2}u=\lambda(1+u)^{p} &amp; {in}\ \ \B, %0&lt;u\leq 1 &amp; {in}\ \ \B, u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} =0 &amp; {on}\ \ \partial \B {array}. $$ has a solution, where $\B$ is the unit ball in $R^{n}$ centered at the origin, $p&gt;\frac{n+4}{n-4}$ and $n$ is the exterior unit normal vector. We show that for $\lambda=\lambda^{*}$ this problem possesses a unique weak solution $u^{*}$, called the extremal solution. We prove that $u^{*}$ is singular when $n\geq 13$ for $p$ large enough, in which case $u^{*}(x)\leq r^{-\frac{4}{p-1}}-1$ on the unit ball.
