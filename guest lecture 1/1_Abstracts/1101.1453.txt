Interaction of the Electromagnetic p-Wave with Thin Metal Film in the  Field of Resonant Frequencies;;; A.V. Latyshev,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Yushkanov_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A.A. Yushkanov</a> ;;; It is shown that for thin metallic films thickness of which does not exceed thickness of skin layer, the problem allows analytical solution. In the field of resonant frequencies the analysis of dependence of coefficients of transmission, reflection and absorbtion on an electromagnetic wave is carried out. Dependence on pitch angle, thickness of the layer and coefficient of specular reflection and on effective electron collision frequency is carried out. The formula for contactless determination (calculation) of a thickness of a film by observable resonant frequencies is deduced.
