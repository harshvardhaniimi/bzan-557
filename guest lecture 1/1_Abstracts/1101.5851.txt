New Bounds on cap sets;;; Michael Bateman,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Katz_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">Nets Hawk Katz</a> ;;; We provide an improvement over Meshulam's bound on cap sets in $F_3^N$. We show that there exist universal $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $C&gt;0$ so that any cap set in $F_3^N$ has size at most $C {3^N \over N^{1+\epsilon}}$. We do this by obtaining quite strong information about the additive combinatorial properties of the large spectrum.
