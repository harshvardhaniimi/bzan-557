Integration without points;;; Igor Kriz,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pultr_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ales Pultr</a> ;;; We develop a theory of Lebesgue integration on abstract Boolean algebras with countable joins. We prove an extension theorem of probability additive functions to countably additive functions in this context, and give a fully functorial treatment of the Segal space in this setting. We also include an interesting non-Gaussian example.
