Statistical Multiresolution Dantzig Estimation in Imaging: Fundamental  Concepts and Algorithmic Framework;;; Klaus Frick,,  <a href="/find/stat/1/au:+Marnitz_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Philipp Marnitz</a>,  <a href="/find/stat/1/au:+Munk_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Axel Munk</a> ;;; In this paper we are concerned with fully automatic and locally adaptive estimation of functions in a "signal + noise"-model where the regression function may additionally be blurred by a linear operator, e.g. by a convolution. To this end, we introduce a general class of statistical multiresolution estimators and develop an algorithmic framework for computing those. By this we mean estimators that are defined as solutions of convex optimization problems with supremum-type constraints. We employ a combination of the alternating direction method of multipliers with Dykstra's algorithm for computing orthogonal projections onto intersections of convex sets and prove numerical convergence. The capability of the proposed method is illustrated by various examples from imaging and signal detection.
