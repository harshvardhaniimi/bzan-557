Generalized hook lengths in symbols and partitions;;; Christine Bessenrodt,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Olsson_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jorn B. Olsson</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Gramain_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jean-Baptiste Gramain</a> ;;; In this paper, we present, for any integer d, a description of the set of hooks in a d-symbol. We then introduce generalized hook length functions for a d-symbol, and prove a general result about them, involving the core and quotient of the symbol. We list some applications, for example to the well-known hook lengths in integer partitions. This leads in particular to a generalization of a relative hook formula for the degree of characters of the symmetric group discovered by G. Malle and G. Navarro in [3].
