Energy cascades and flux locality in physical scales of the 3D  Navier-Stokes equations;;; R. Dascaliuc,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Grujic_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Z. Grujic</a> ;;; Rigorous estimates for the total - (kinetic) energy plus pressure - flux in R^3 are obtained from the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The bounds are used to establish a condition - involving Taylor length scale and the size of the domain - sufficient for existence of the inertial range and the energy cascade in decaying turbulence (zero driving force, non-increasing global energy). Several manifestations of the locality of the flux under this condition are obtained. All the scales involved are actual physical scales in R^3 and no regularity or homogeneity/scaling assumptions are made.
