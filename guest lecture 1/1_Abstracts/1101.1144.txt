Curvature tensor under the Ricci-Harmonic flow;;; Anqiang Zhu,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Cheng_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Liang Cheng</a> ;;; We prove that if the Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded under the Ricci-Harmonic flow for all times $t$ \in[0, T), then the curvature tensor has to be uniformly bounded as well.
