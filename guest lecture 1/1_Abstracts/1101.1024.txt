Gaussian free field and conformal field theory;;; Nam-Gyu Kang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Makarov_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">Nikolai Makarov</a> ;;; In these expository lectures, we give an elementary introduction to conformal field theory in the context of probability theory and complex analysis. We consider statistical fields, and define Ward functionals in terms of their Lie derivatives. Based on this approach, we explain some equations of conformal field theory and outline their relation to SLE theory.
