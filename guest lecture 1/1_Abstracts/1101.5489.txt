Tautological and non-tautological cohomology of the moduli space of  curves;;; C. Faber,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pandharipande_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">R. Pandharipande</a> ;;; After a short exposition of the basic properties of the tautological ring of the moduli space of genus g Deligne-Mumford stable curves with n markings, we explain three methods of detecting non-tautological classes in cohomology. The first is via curve counting over finite fields. The second is by obtaining length bounds on the action of the symmetric group S_n on tautological classes. The third is via classical boundary geometry. Several new non-tautological classes are found.
