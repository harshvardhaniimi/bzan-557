Critical window for the vacant set left by random walk on random regular  graphs;;; Jiri Cerny,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Teixeira_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Augusto Teixeira</a> ;;; We consider the simple random walk on a random d-regular graph with n vertices, and investigate percolative properties of the set of vertices not visited by the walk until time un, where u &gt; 0 is a fixed positive parameter. It was shown in [<a href="/abs/1012.5117">arXiv:1012.5117</a>] that this so-called vacant set exhibits a phase transition at u = u*: there is a giant component if u &lt; u* and only small components when u &gt; u*. In this paper we show the existence of a critical window of size n^(-1/3) around u*. In this window the size of the largest cluster is of order n^(2/3).
