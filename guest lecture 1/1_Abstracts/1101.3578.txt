Infinity in computable probability;;; Maarten McKubre-Jordens,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wilson_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Phillip L. Wilson</a> ;;; Here we show, contrary to the classical supposition, that a process for generating symbols according to some probability distribution need not, with any likelihood, produce a given finite text in any finite time, even if it is guaranteed to produce the text in infinite time. The result extends to target-free text generation and has implications for simulations of probabilistic processes.
