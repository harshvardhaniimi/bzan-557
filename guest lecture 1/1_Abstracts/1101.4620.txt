Unconditionally Secure Bit Commitment with Flying Qudits;;; Adrian Kent, (Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations, DAMTP, University of Cambridge and Perimeter Institute) ;;; In the task cryptographers call bit commitment, one party encrypts a prediction in a way that cannot be decrypted until they supply a key, but has only one valid key. Bit commitment has many applications, and has been much studied, but completely and provably secure schemes have remained elusive. Here we report a new development in physics-based cryptography which gives a completely new way of implementing bit commitment that is perfectly secure. The technique involves sending a quantum state (for instance one or more photons) at light speed in one of two or more directions, either along a secure channel or by quantum teleportation. Its security proof relies on the no-cloning theorem of quantum theory and the no superluminal signalling principle of special relativity.
