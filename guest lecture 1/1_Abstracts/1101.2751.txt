Covariant Fields of C*-Algebras and Continuity of Spectra in Rieffel&#x27;s  Pseudodifferential Calculus;;; F. Belmonte,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mantoiu_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">M. Mantoiu</a> ;;; We show that Rieffel's functor sends covariant C(T)-algebras in C(T)-algebras and covariant continuous fields of C*-algebras in continuous fields of C*-algebras. We use this to prove spectral continuity results for families of Rieffel-type pseudodifferential operators.
