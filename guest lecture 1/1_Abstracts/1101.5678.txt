For time-independent fields Pauli obtained a famous beautiful nonrelativistic approximation. We are going to consider a special 2D case where the electric field is equal to zero. The remarkable theory of this operator starts in 1979--80. In the present work we found unification of the Theory of Ground States for the Pauli Operator with the Algebro-Geometric Spectral Theory of periodic scalar Schr\"odinger operators and corresponding theory of soliton nonlinear systems. Especially analog of the 2D Burgers hierarchy plays a key role here. The Aharonov--Bohm type terms in magnetic field like the quantized delta function also play important role in our construction. This work extends results published in <a href="/abs/1001.4300">arXiv:1001.4300</a>, <a href="/abs/1004.1157">arXiv:1004.1157</a>, <a href="/abs/1005.0612">arXiv:1005.0612</a>. We pay special attention to the boundary problems allowing to reveal physical meaning of the complex Bloch functions.
