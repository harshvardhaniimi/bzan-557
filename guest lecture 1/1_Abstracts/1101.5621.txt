Finite connectivity in infinite matroids;;; Henning Bruhn,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wollan_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Paul Wollan</a> ;;; We introduce a connectivity function for infinite matroids with properties similar to the connectivity function of a finite matroid, such as submodularity and invariance under duality. As an application we use it to extend Tutte's linking theorem to finitary and to co-finitary matroids.
