Smooth Attractors for the Brinkman-Forchheimer equations with fast  growing nonlinearities;;; Varga K. Kalantarov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zelik_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sergey Zelik</a> ;;; We prove the existence of regular dissipative solutions and global attractors for the 3D Brinkmann-Forchheimer equations with the nonlinearity of an arbitrary polynomial growth rate. In order to obtain this result, we prove the maximal regularity estimate for the corresponding semi-linear stationary Stokes problem using some modification of the nonlinear localization technique. The applications of our results to the Brinkmann-Forchheimer equation with the Navier-Stokes inertial term are also considered.
