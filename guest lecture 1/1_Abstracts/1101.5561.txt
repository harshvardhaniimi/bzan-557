Local real analysis in locally homogeneous spaces;;; Marco Bramanti,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zhu_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Maochun Zhu</a> ;;; We introduce the concept of locally homogeneous space, and prove in this context L^p and Holder estimates for singular and fractional integrals, as well as L^p estimates on the commutator of a singular or fractional integral with a BMO or VMO function. These results are motivated by local a-priori estimates for subelliptic equations.
