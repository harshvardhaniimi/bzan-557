Study of classical mechanical systems with complex potentials;;; A. Sinha,,  <a href="/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Dutta_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">D. Dutta</a>,  <a href="/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Roy_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">P. Roy</a> ;;; We apply the factorization technique developed by Kuru and Negro [Ann. Phys. 323 (2008) 413] to study complex classical systems. As an illustration we apply the technique to study the classical analogue of the exactly solvable PT symmetric Scarf II model, which exhibits the interesting phenomenon of spontaneous breakdown of PT symmetry at some critical point. As the parameters are tuned such that energy switches from real to complex conjugate pairs, the corresponding classical trajectories display a distinct characteristic feature - the closed orbits become open ones.
