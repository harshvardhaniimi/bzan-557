Gamma Limit for Transition Paths of Maximal Probability;;; F. Pinski,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Stuart_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A.M. Stuart</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Theil_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">F. Theil</a> ;;; Chemical reactions can be modelled via diffusion processes conditioned to make a transition between specified molecular configurations representing the state of the system before and after the chemical reaction. In particular the model of Brownian dynamics - gradient flow subject to additive noise - is frequently used. If the chemical reaction is specified to take place on a given time interval, then the most likely path taken by the system is a minimizer of the Onsager-Machlup functional. The Gamma limit of this functional is determined in the case where the temperature is small and the transition time scales as the inverse temperature
