Cram&#xe9;r theorem for Gamma random variables;;; Solesne Bourguin, (SAMM),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tudor_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ciprian Tudor</a> (LPP) ;;; In this paper we discuss the following problem: given a random variable $Z=X+Y$ with Gamma law such that $X$ and $Y$ are independent, we want to understand if then $X$ and $Y$ {\it each} follow a Gamma law. This is related to Cram\'er's theorem which states that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent then $Z=X+Y$ follows a Gaussian law if and only if $X$ {\it and} $Y$ follow a Gaussian law. We prove that Cram\'er's theorem is true in the Gamma context for random variables leaving in a Wiener chaos of fixed order but the result is not true in general. We also give an asymptotic variant of our result.
