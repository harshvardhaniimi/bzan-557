Are Time-Domain Self-Force Calculations Contaminated by Jost Solutions?;;; Jose Luis Jaramillo, (1 and 2),  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Sopuerta_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Carlos F.

Here we address the question of the possible emergence of a persistent spurious solution in time-domain schemes, referred to as a {\em Jost junk solution} in the literature, that may contaminate self force calculations. Previous studies suggested that Jost solutions are due to the use of zero initial data, which is inconsistent with the singular sources associated with the small object, described as a point mass. However, in this work we show that the specific origin is an inconsistency in the translation of the singular sources into jump conditions. More importantly, we identify the correct implementation of the sources at late times as the sufficient condition guaranteeing the absence of Jost junk solutions.
