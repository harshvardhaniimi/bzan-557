Orbit Determination with the two-body Integrals. II;;; Giovanni F. Gronchi,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Farnocchia_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Davide Farnocchia</a>,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Dimare_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Linda Dimare</a> ;;; The first integrals of the Kepler problem are used to compute preliminary orbits starting from two short observed arcs of a celestial body, which may be obtained either by optical or radar observations. We write polynomial equations for this problem, that we can solve using the powerful tools of computational Algebra. An algorithm to decide if the linkage of two short arcs is successful, i.e. if they belong to the same observed body, is proposed and tested numerically. In this paper we continue the research started in [Gronchi, Dimare, Milani, 'Orbit determination with the two-body intergrals', CMDA (2010) 107/3, 299-318], where the angular momentum and the energy integrals were used. A suitable component of the Laplace-Lenz vector in place of the energy turns out to be convenient, in fact the degree of the resulting system is reduced to less than half.
