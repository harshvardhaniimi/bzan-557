Operations on fuzzy ideals of $\Gamma$-semirings;;; T. K. Dutta,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sardar_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sujit Kumar Sardar</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Goswami_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sarbani Goswami</a> ;;; The purpose of this paper is to introduce different types of operations on fuzzy ideals of $\Gamma$-semirings and to prove subsequently that these oprations give rise to different structures such as complete lattice, modular lattice on some restricted class of fuzzy ideals of $\Gamma$-semirings. A characterization of a regular $\Gamma$-semiring has also been obtained in terms of fuzzy subsets.
