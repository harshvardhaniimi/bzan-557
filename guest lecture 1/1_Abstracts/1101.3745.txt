Some necessary conditions for vector space partitions;;; Olof Heden,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lehmann_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Juliane Lehmann</a> ;;; Some new necessary conditions for the existence of vector space partitions are derived. They are applied to the problem of finding the maximum number of spaces of dimension t in a vector space partition of V(2t,q) that contains m_d spaces of dimension d, where t/2&lt;d&lt;t, and also spaces of other dimensions. It is also discussed how this problem is related to maximal partial t-spreads in V(2t,q). We also give a lower bound for the number of spaces in a vector space partition and verify that this bound is tight.
