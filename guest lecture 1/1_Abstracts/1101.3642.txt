On the Noncommutative Bondal-Orlov Conjecture;;; Osamu Iyama,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wemyss_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Michael Wemyss</a> ;;; Let R be a normal, equi-codimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring of dimension $d\geq 2$ with a canonical module. We give a sufficient criterion that establishes a derived equivalence between the noncommutative crepant resolutions of R. When $d\leq 3$ this criterion is always satisfied and so all noncommutative crepant resolutions of R are derived equivalent. Our method is based on cluster tilting theory for commutative algebras, developed in [IW10].
