Rainbow connections of graphs -- A survey;;; Xueliang Li,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sun_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yuefang Sun</a> ;;; The concept of rainbow connection was introduced by Chartrand et al. in 2008. It is fairly interesting and recently quite a lot papers have been published about it. In this survey we attempt to bring together most of the results and papers that dealt with it. We begin with an introduction, and then try to organize the work into five categories, including (strong) rainbow connection number, rainbow $k$-connectivity, $k$-rainbow index, rainbow vertex-connection number, algorithms and computational complexity. This survey also contains some conjectures, open problems or questions.
