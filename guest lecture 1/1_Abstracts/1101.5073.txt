A double-ended queue with catastrophes and repairs, and a jump-diffusion  approximation;;; Antonio Di Crescenzo,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Giorno_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">Virginia Giorno</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kumar_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Balasubramanian Krishna Kumar</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Nobile_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Amelia G. Nobile</a> ;;; Consider a system performing a continuous-time random walk on the integers, subject to catastrophes occurring at constant rate, and followed by exponentially-distributed repair times. After any repair the system starts anew from state zero. We study both the transient and steady-state probability laws of the stochastic process that describes the state of the system. We then derive a heavy-traffic approximation to the model that yields a jump-diffusion process. The latter is equivalent to a Wiener process subject to randomly occurring jumps, whose probability law is obtained. The goodness of the approximation is finally discussed.
