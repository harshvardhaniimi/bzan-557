Gravitational sources induced by exotic smoothness;;; T. Asselmeyer-Maluga,,  <a href="/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Brans_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">C.H. Brans</a> ;;; In this paper we construct a coordinate atlas in an exotic $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ using Bizaca's construction. The main source for such an atlas is the handle body decomposition of a Casson handle, which of course is an infinite, but periodic, process. The immersion of the end-periodic manifold into $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is directly related to the exoticness of the $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and also gives rise naturally to a spinor field. Thus we obtain the interesting result that the simplest exotic $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ generates an extra spinor field by exoticness.
