Harmonic Analysis on chord arc domains;;; E. Milakis,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pipher_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">J. Pipher</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Toro_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T. Toro</a> ;;; In the present paper we study the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for second order divergence form elliptic operators with bounded measurable coefficients which are small perturbations of given operators in rough domains beyond the Lipschitz category. In our approach, the development of the theory of tent spaces on these domains is essential.
