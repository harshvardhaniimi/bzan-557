L2 d-bar cohomology groups of some singular complex spaces;;; Nils Ovrelid,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Vassiliadou_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sophia Vassiliadou</a> ;;; Let X be a pure n-dimensional (n&gt;1) complex analytic set in C^N with an isolated singularity at 0. In this paper we express the L2-(0,q)-d-bar-cohomology groups for all q with 0&lt;q&lt;n+1, of a sufficiently small deleted neighborhood of the singular point, in terms of resolution data. We also obtain identifications of the L2-(0,q)-d-bar-cohomology groups of the smooth points of X in terms of resolution data, when X is either compact or an open relatively compact complex analytic subset of a reduced complex space with finitely many isolated singularities.
