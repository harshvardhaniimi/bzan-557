Essential commutation of composition and integral-type operators;;; Ce-Zhong Tong,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zhou_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ze-Hua Zhou</a> ;;; Let $H^\infty$ represent the bounded holomorphic function algebra on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ in the complex plane. The Bloch space and little Bloch space in $\mathbb{D}$ are denoted by $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}_0$ respectively. In this paper, we investigate the essential commutation of composition and integral-type operators from $H^\infty$ or $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ or $\mathcal{B}_0$. Corresponding results for the boundedness and compactness have also been obtained.
