Geometrization of Three-Dimensional Orbifolds via Ricci Flow;;; Bruce Kleiner,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lott_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">John Lott</a> ;;; A three-dimensional closed orientable orbifold (with no bad suborbifolds) is known to have a geometric decomposition from work of Perelman along with earlier work of Boileau-Leeb-Porti and Cooper-Hodgson-Kerckhoff. We give a new, logically independent, unified proof of the geometrization of orbifolds, using Ricci flow. Along the way we develop some tools for the geometry of orbifolds that may be of independent interest.
