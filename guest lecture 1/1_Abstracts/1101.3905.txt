Geometric realizations of two dimensional substitutive tilings;;; Nicolas Bedaride, (LATP),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Hilion_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Arnaud Hilion</a> (LATP) ;;; We define 2-dimensional topological substitutions. A tiling of the Euclidean plane, or of the hyperbolic plane, is substitutive if the underlying 2-complex can be obtained by iteration of a 2-dimensional topological substitution. We prove that there is no primitive substitutive tiling of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. However, we give an example of substitutive tiling of $\Hyp^2$ which is non-primitive.
