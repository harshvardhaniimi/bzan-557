Shrinking targets in fast mixing flows and the geodesic flow on  negatively curved manifolds;;; Stefano Galatolo,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Nisoli_I/0/1/0/all/0/1">Isaia Nisoli</a> ;;; We show that in a rapidly mixing flow with an invariant measure, the time which is needed to hit a given section is related to a sort of conditional dimension of the measure at the section. The result is applied to the geodesic flow of compact variable negative sectional curvature manifolds, establishing a logarithm law for such kind of flow.
