Estimation of means in graphical Gaussian models with symmetries;;; Helene Gehrmann,,  <a href="/find/math,stat/1/au:+Lauritzen_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Steffen L. Lauritzen</a> ;;; We study the problem of estimability of means in undirected graphical Gaussian models with symmetry restrictions represented by a colored graph. Following on from previous studies, we partition the variables into sets of vertices whose corresponding means are restricted to being identical. We find a necessary and sufficient condition on the partition to ensure equality between the maximum likelihood and least-squares estimators of the mean.
