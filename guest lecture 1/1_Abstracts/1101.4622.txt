The One-dimensional KPZ Equation and the Airy Process;;; Sylvain Prolhac,,  <a href="/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Spohn_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Herbert Spohn</a> ;;; Our previous work on the one-dimensional KPZ equation with sharp wedge initial data is extended to the case of the joint height statistics at n spatial points for some common fixed time. Assuming a particular factorization, we compute an n-point generating function and write it in terms of a Fredholm determinant. For long times the generating function converges to a limit, which is established to be equivalent to the standard expression of the n-point distribution of the Airy process.
