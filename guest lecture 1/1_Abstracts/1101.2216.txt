Meromorphic Line Bundles and Holomorphic Gerbes;;; Edoardo Ballico,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ben_Bassat_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Oren Ben-Bassat</a> ;;; We show that any complex manifold that has a divisor whose normalization has non-zero first Betti number either has a non-trivial holomorphic gerbe which does not trivialize meromorphicly or a meromorphic line bundle not equivalent to any holomorphic line bundle. Similarly, higher Betti numbers of divisors correspond to higher gerbes or meromorphic gerbes. We give several new examples.
