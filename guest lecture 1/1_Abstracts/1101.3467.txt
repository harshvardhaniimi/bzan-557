Functoriality for General Spin Groups;;; Mahdi Asgari,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Shahidi_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Freydoon Shahidi</a> ;;; We establish the functorial transfer of generic, automorphic representations from the quasi-split general spin groups to general linear groups over arbitrary number fields, completing an earlier project. Our results are definitive and, in particular, we determine the image of this transfer completely and give a number of applications.
