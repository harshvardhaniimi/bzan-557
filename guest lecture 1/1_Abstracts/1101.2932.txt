Fractional Variational Calculus with Classical and Combined Caputo  Derivatives;;; Tatiana Odzijewicz,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Malinowska_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Agnieszka B. Malinowska</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Torres_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Delfim F. M. Torres</a> ;;; We give a proper fractional extension of the classical calculus of variations by considering variational functionals with a Lagrangian depending on a combined Caputo fractional derivative and the classical derivative. Euler-Lagrange equations to the basic and isoperimetric problems are proved, as well as transversality conditions.
