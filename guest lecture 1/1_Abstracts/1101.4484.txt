Some general results on conformal embeddings of affine vertex operator  algebras;;; Drazen Adamovic,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Perse_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ozren Perse</a> ;;; We give a general criterion for conformal embeddings of vertex operator algebras associated to affine Lie algebras at arbitrary levels. Using that criterion, we construct new conformal embeddings at admissible rational and negative integer levels. In particular, we construct all remaining conformal embeddings associated to automorphisms of Dynkin diagrams of simple Lie algebras. The semisimplicity of the corresponding decompositions is obtained by using the concept of fusion rules for vertex operator algebras.
