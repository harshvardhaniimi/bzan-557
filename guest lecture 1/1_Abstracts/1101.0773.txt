Factorization Method in Curvilinear Coordinates and Pairing of Levels  for Matrix Potentials;;; A.A.Andrianov,,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Ioffe_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">M.V.Ioffe</a>,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Zhun_Pin_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tsu Zhun-Pin</a> ;;; Multidimensional factorization method is formulated in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates. Particular cases of polar and spherical coordinates are considered and matrix potentials with separating variables are constructed. A new class of matrix potentials is obtained which reveals a double degeneracy or equidistant splitting of energy levels (hidden symmetry).
