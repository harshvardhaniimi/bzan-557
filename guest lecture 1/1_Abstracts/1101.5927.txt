Projection bodies in complex vector spaces;;; Judit Abardia,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Bernig_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Andreas Bernig</a> ;;; The space of Minkowski valuations on an m-dimensional complex vector space which are continuous, translation invariant and contravariant under the complex special linear group is explicitly described. Each valuation with these properties is shown to satisfy geometric inequalities of Brunn-Minkowski, Aleksandrov-Fenchel and Minkowski type.
