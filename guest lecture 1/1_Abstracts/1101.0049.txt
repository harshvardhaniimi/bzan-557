On the semigroup of partial isometries of a finite chain;;; Rotimi Kehinde,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Umar_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Abdullahi Umar</a> ;;; Let ${\cal I}_n$ be the symmetric inverse semigroup on $X_n = \{1, 2,..., n\}$ and let ${\cal DP}_n$ and ${\cal ODP}_n$ be its subsemigroups of partial isometries and of order-preserving partial isometries of $X_n$, respectively. In this paper we investigate the cycle structure of a partial isometry and characterize the Green's relations on ${\cal DP}_n$ and ${\cal ODP}_n$. We show that ${\cal ODP}_n$ is a $0-E-unitary$ inverse semigroup. We also investigate the cardinalities of some equivalences on ${\cal DP}_n$ and ${\cal ODP}_n$ which lead naturally to obtaining the order of the semigroups.
