A low-memory algorithm for finding short product representations in  finite groups;;; Gaetan Bisson,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sutherland_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Andrew V. Sutherland</a> ;;; We describe a space-efficient algorithm for solving a generalization of the subset sum problem in a finite group G, using a Pollard-rho approach. Given an element z and a sequence of elements S, our algorithm attempts to find a subsequence of S whose product in G is equal to z. For a random sequence S of length d log_2 n, where n=#G and d &gt;= 2 is a constant, we find that its expected running time is O(sqrt(n) log n) group operations (we give a rigorous proof for d &gt; 4), and it only needs to store O(1) group elements. We consider applications to class groups of imaginary quadratic fields, and to finding isogenies between elliptic curves over a finite field.
