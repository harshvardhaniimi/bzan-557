Geometrizing the minimal representations of even orthogonal groups;;; Vincent Lafforgue,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lysenko_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sergey Lysenko</a> ;;; Let X be a smooth projective curve. Write Bun_{SO_{2n}} for the moduli stack of SO_{2n}-torsors on X. We give a geometric interpretation of the automorphic function f on Bun_{SO_{2n}} corresponding to the minimal representation. Namely, we construct a perverse sheaf K on Bun_{SO_{2n}} such that f should be equal to the trace of Frobenius of K plus some constant function. We also calculate K explicitely for curves of genus zero and one. The construction of K is based on some explicit geometric formulas for the Fourier coefficients of f on one hand, and on the geometric theta-lifting on the other hand. Our construction makes sense for more general simple algebraic groups, we formulate the corresponding conjectures. They could provide a geometric interpretation of some unipotent automorphic representations in the framework of the geometric Langlands program.
