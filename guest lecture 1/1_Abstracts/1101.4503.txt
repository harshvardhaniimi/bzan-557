Cocharacters of polynomial identities of upper triangular matrices;;; Silvia Boumova,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Drensky_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">Vesselin Drensky</a> ;;; We give an easy algorithm which calculates the generating function of the cocharacter sequence of the T-ideal of the polynomial identities of the algebra of upper triangular matrices over a field of characteristic zero. Applying this algorithm we have found the explicit form of the multiplicities in two cases: (i) for the "largest" partitions; (ii) for matrices of small size and for all partitions.
