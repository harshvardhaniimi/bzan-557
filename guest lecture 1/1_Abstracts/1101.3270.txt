Its most vexing problem is that in some cases it produces `convergence to the wrong limit'. In the first part of the paper we go through the formal justification of the method, identify points at which it may fail and identify a necessary and sufficient criterion for correctness. This criterion would, however, require checking infinitely many identities, and therefore is somewhat academic. We propose instead a truncation to the check of a few identities; this still gives a necessary criterion, but a priori it is not clear whether it remains sufficient. In the second part we carry out a detailed study of two toy models: first we identify the reasons why in some cases the method fails, second we test the efficiency of the truncated criterion and find that it works perfectly at least in the toy models studied.
