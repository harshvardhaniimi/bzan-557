Sums of many primes;;; Alessandro Languasco,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zaccagnini_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alessandro Zaccagnini</a> ;;; Assuming that the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) holds, we prove an explicit formula for the number of representations of an integer as a sum of $k\geq 5$ primes. Our error terms in such a formula improve by some logarithmic factors an analogous result by Friedlander-Goldston.
