Some remarks on singular solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations. III:  viscosity solutions, including parabolic operators;;; Luis Caffarelli,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Li_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">YanYan Li</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Nirenberg_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Louis Nirenberg</a> ;;; The paper concerns singular solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations, which include removable singularities for viscosity solutions, a strengthening of the Hopf Lemma including parabolic equations, Strong maximum principle and Hopf Lemma for viscosity solutions including also parabolic equations.
