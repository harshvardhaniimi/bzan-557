Analyticity of extremisers to the Airy Strichartz inequality;;; Dirk Hundertmark,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Shao_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Shuanglin Shao</a> ;;; We prove that there exists an extremal function to the Airy Strichartz inequality, $e^{-t\partial_x^3}: L^2(\mathbb{R})\to L^8_{t,x}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ by using the linear profile decomposition. Furthermore we show that, if $f$ is an extremiser, then $f$ is extremely fast decaying in Fourier space and so $f$ can be extended to be an entire function on the whole complex domain. The rapid decay of the Fourier transform of extremisers is established with a bootstrap argument which relies on a refined bilinear Airy Strichartz estimate and a weighted Strichartz inequality.
