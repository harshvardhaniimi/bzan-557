Curvature-dimension inequalities and Ricci lower bounds for  sub-Riemannian manifolds with transverse symmetries;;; Fabrice Baudoin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Garofalo_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">Nicola Garofalo</a> ;;; Let $\M$ be a smooth connected manifold endowed with a smooth measure $\mu$ and a smooth locally subelliptic diffusion operator $L$ satisfying $L1=0$, and which is symmetric with respect to $\mu$. Associated with $L$ one has \textit{le carr\'e du champ} $\Gamma$ and a canonical distance $d$, with respect to which we suppose that $(M,d)$ be complete. We assume that $\M$ is also equipped with another first-order differential bilinear form $\Gamma^Z$ and we assume that $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^Z$ satisfy the Hypothesis below. With these forms we introduce in \eqref{cdi} below a generalization of the curvature-dimension inequality from Riemannian geometry, see Definition \ref{D:cdi}. In our main results we prove that, using solely \eqref{cdi}, one can develop a theory which parallels the celebrated works of Yau, and Li-Yau on complete manifolds with Ricci bounded from below. We also obtain an analogue of the Bonnet-Myers theorem. In Section \ref{S:appendix} we construct large classes of sub-Riemannian manifolds with transverse symmetries which satisfy the generalized curvature-dimension inequality \eqref{cdi}. Such classes include all Sasakian manifolds whose horizontal Webster-Tanaka-Ricci curvature is bounded from below, all Carnot groups with step two, and wide subclasses of principal bundles over Riemannian manifolds whose Ricci curvature is bounded from below.
