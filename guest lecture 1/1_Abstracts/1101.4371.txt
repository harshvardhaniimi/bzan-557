Asymptotics of Orthogonal Polynomials via Recurrence Relations;;; X.-S. Wang,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wong_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">R. Wong</a> ;;; We use the Legendre polynomials and the Hermite polynomials as two examples to illustrate a simple and systematic technique on deriving asymptotic formulas for orthogonal polynomials via recurrence relations. Another application of this technique is to provide a solution to a problem recently raised by M. E. H. Ismail.
