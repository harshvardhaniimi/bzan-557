Reductions of piecewise trivial principal comodule algebras;;; Piotr M. Hajac,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zielinski_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Bartosz Zielinski</a> ;;; The structure group of a principal bundle is reducible to a subgroup if there exists a local trivialisation with respect to which all transition functions take values in this subgroup. Conversely, if a principal bundle is reducible to a locally trivial principal subbundle, then there exists a local trivialisation of the bundle such that all transition functions take values in the structure group of the subbundle. We prove a noncommutative-geometric counterpart of this theorem. To this end, we employ the concept of a piecewise trivial principal comodule algebra as a suitable replacement of a locally trivial compact principal bundle. To enclose natural and geometrically interesting noncommutative examples, we use smash products (cocycle-free crossed products) rather than tensor products as a generalisation of trivial principal bundles. These examples serve as a testing ground for our reduction theorem, and include bundles over noncommutative lens spaces.
