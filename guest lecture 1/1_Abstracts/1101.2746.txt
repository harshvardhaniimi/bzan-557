Mirror symmetry and projective geometry of Reye congruences I;;; Shinobu Hosono,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Takagi_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hiromichi Takagi</a> ;;; Studying the mirror symmetry of a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ of the Reye congruence in $\mP^4$, we conjecture that $X$ has a non-trivial Fourier-Mukai partner $Y$. We construct $Y$ as the double cover of a determinantal quintic in $\mP^4$ branched over a curve. We also calculate BPS numbers of both $X$ and $Y$ (and also a related Calabi-Yau complete intersection $\tilde X_0$) using mirror symmetry.
