Matrix superpotentials;;; A.G. Nikitin,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Karadzhov_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yuri Karadzhov</a> ;;; We present a collection of matrix valued shape invariant potentials which give rise to new exactly solvable problems of SUSY quantum mechanics. It includes all irreducible matrix superpotentials of the generic form $W=kQ+\frac1k R+P$ where $k$ is a variable parameter, $Q$ is the unit matrix multiplied by a real valued function of independent variable $x$, and $P$, $R$ are hermitian matrices depending on $x$. In particular we recover the Pron'ko-Stroganov "matrix Coulomb potential" and all known scalar shape invariant potentials of SUSY quantum mechanics. In addition, five new shape invariant potentials are presented. Three of them admit a dual shape invariance, i.e., the related hamiltonians can be factorized using two non-equivalent superpotentials. We find discrete spectrum and eigenvectors for the corresponding Schroedinger equations and prove that these eigenvectors are normalizable.
