Reflection algebra, Yangian symmetry and bound-states in AdS/CFT;;; Niall MacKay,,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Regelskis_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">Vidas Regelskis</a> ;;; We present the `Heisenberg picture' of the reflection algebra by explicitly constructing the boundary Yangian symmetry of an AdS/CFT superstring which ends on a boundary with non-trivial degrees of freedom and which preserves the full bulk Lie symmetry algebra. We also consider the spectrum of bulk and boundary states and some automorphisms of the underlying algebras.
