Algebraic and arithmetic area for $m$ planar Brownian paths;;; Jean Desbois,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Ouvry_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Stephane Ouvry</a> ;;; The leading and next to leading terms of the average arithmetic area $&lt; S(m)&gt;$ enclosed by $m\to\infty$ independent closed Brownian planar paths, with a given length $t$ and starting from and ending at the same point, is calculated. The leading term is found to be $&lt; S(m) &gt; \sim {\pi t\over 2}\ln m$ and the $0$-winding sector arithmetic area inside the $m$ paths is subleading in the asymptotic regime. A closed form expression for the algebraic area distribution is also obtained and discussed.
