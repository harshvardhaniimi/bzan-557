Rotated multifractal network generator;;; G. Palla,,  <a href="/find/physics/1/au:+Pollner_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">P. Pollner</a>,  <a href="/find/physics/1/au:+Vicsek_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T. Vicsek</a> ;;; The recently introduced multifractal network generator (MFNG), has been shown to provide a simple and flexible tool for creating random graphs with very diverse features. The MFNG is based on multifractal measures embedded in 2d, leading also to isolated nodes, whose number is relatively low for realistic cases, but may become dominant in the limiting case of infinitely large network sizes. Here we discuss the relation between this effect and the information dimension for the 1d projection of the link probability measure (LPM), and argue that the node isolation can be avoided by a simple transformation of the LPM based on rotation.
