The question of constructing optimal approximating spline for each function proved to be very hard. In fact, no polynomial time algorithm of adaptive spline approximation can be designed and no exact formula for the optimal error of approximation can be given. Therefore, the next natural question would be to study the asymptotic behavior of the error and construct asymptotically optimal sequences of partitions. In this paper we provide sharp asymptotic estimates for the error of interpolation by splines on block partitions in IRd. We consider various projection operators to define the interpolant and provide the analysis of the exact constant in the asymptotics as well as its explicit form in certain cases.
