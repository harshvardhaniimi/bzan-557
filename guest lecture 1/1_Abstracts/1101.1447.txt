A sharp Strichartz estimate for the wave equation with data in the  energy space;;; Neal Bez,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Rogers_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">Keith M. Rogers</a> ;;; We prove a sharp bilinear estimate for the wave equation from which we obtain the sharp constant in the Strichartz estimate which controls the $L^4_{t,x}(\R^{5+1})$ norm of the solution in terms of the energy. We also characterise the maximisers.
