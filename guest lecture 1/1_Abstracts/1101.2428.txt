Geodesics in CAT(0) Cubical Complexes;;; Federico Ardila,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Owen_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Megan Owen</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sullivant_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Seth Sullivant</a> ;;; We describe an algorithm to compute the geodesics in an arbitrary CAT(0) cubical complex. A key tool is a correspondence between cubical complexes of global non-positive curvature and posets with inconsistent pairs. This correspondence also gives an explicit realization of such a complex as the state complex of a reconfigurable system, and a way to embed any interval in the integer lattice cubing of its dimension.
