Classification of 5-Dimensional MD-Algebras Having Non-Commutative  Derived Ideals;;; Le Anh Vu,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Hieu_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ha Van Hieu</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Nghia_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tran Thi Hieu Nghia</a> ;;; The paper presents a subclass of the class of MD5-algebras and MD5-groups, i.e. five dimensional solvable Lie algebras and Lie groups such that their orbits in the co-adjoint representation (K-orbits) are orbits of zero or maximal dimension. The main result of the paper is the classification up to an isomorphism of all MD5-algebras with the non-commutative derived ideal. With this result, we have the complete classification of 5-dimensional solvable Lie algebras.
