Conic bundles and Clifford algebras;;; Daniel Chan,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ingalls_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Colin Ingalls</a> ;;; We discuss natural connections between three objects: quadratic forms with values in line bundles, conic bundles and quaternion orders. We use the even Clifford algebra, and the Brauer-Severi Variety, and other constructions to give natural bijections between these objects under appropriate hypothesis. We then restrict to a surface base and we express the second Chern class of the order in terms $K^3$ and other invariants of the corresponding conic bundle. We find the conic bundles corresponding to minimal del Pezzo quaterion orders and we discuss problems concerning their moduli.
