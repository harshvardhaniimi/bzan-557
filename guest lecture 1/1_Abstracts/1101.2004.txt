Laplacian Flow for Closed $G_2$-Structures: Short Time Behavior;;; Robert Bryant,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xu_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Feng Xu</a> ;;; We prove short time existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Laplacian flow for closed $G_2$ structures on a compact manifold $M^7$. The result was claimed in \cite{BryantG2}, but its proof has never appeared.
