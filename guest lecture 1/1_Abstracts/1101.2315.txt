On the splitting method for some complex-valued quasilinear equations;;; Zdzislaw Brzezniak,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Millet_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Annie Millet</a> (SAMM, PMA) ;;; Using the approach of the splitting method developed by I. Gy\"ongy and N. Krylov for parabolic quasi linear equations, we study the speed of convergence for general complex-valued stochastic evolution equations. The approximation is given in general Sobolev spaces and the model considered here contains both the parabolic quasi-linear equations under some (non strict) stochastic parabolicity condition as well as linear Schr\"odinger equations
