Derivations of the Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebras;;; Elisabete Barreiro,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Elduque_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alberto Elduque</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Martinez_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Consuelo Martinez</a> ;;; The derivations of the Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebras are studied. It is shown that, assuming -1 is a square in the ground field, the Lie superalgebra of derivations of a Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebra is isomorphic to the Lie superalgebra obtained from a simpler Jordan superalgebra (a Kantor double superalgebra of vector type) by means of the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction. This is done by exploiting the S4-symmetry of the Cheng-Kac Jordan superalgebra.
