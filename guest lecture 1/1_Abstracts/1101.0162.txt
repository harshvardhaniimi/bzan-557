Truncated moment problems in the class of generalized Nevanlinna  functions;;; Vladimir Derkach,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Hassi_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Seppo Hassi</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Snoo_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Henk de Snoo</a> ;;; Truncated moment problems in the class of generalized Nevanlinna functions are investigated. General solvability criteria will be established, covering both the even and odd problems, including complete parametrizations of solutions. The main new results concern the case where the corresponding Hankel matrix of moments is degenerate. One of the new effects which reveals in the indefinite case is that the degenerated moment problem may have infinitely many solutions. However, with a careful application of an indefinite analogue of a step-by-step Schur algorithm a complete description of the set of solutions will be obtained.
