The main contributions of the paper are two distributed JSCC schemes: one discrete scheme based on nested scalar quantization, and one hybrid discrete-analog scheme based on a scalar quantizer and a linear continuous mapping. The proposed schemes show promising performance which improve with increasing correlation and are robust against variations in noise level. Both schemes exhibit a constant gap to the performance upper bound when the channel signal-to-noise ratio gets large.
