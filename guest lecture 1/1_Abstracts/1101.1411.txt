Volume growth, eigenvalue and compactness for self-shrinkers;;; Qi Ding,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Xin_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Y. L. Xin</a> ;;; In this paper, we show an optimal volume growth for self-shrinkers, and estimate a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}$ operator on self-shrinkers, inspired by the first eigenvalue conjecture on minimal hypersurfaces in the unit sphere. By the eigenvalue estimates, we can prove a compactness theorem obtained by Colding-Minicozzi under weaker conditions.
