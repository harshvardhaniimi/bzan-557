Monotone drawings of planar graphs;;; Janos Pach,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Toth_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Geza Toth</a> ;;; Let G be a graph drawn in the plane so that its edges are represented by x-monotone curves, any pair of which cross an even number of times. We show that G can be redrawn in such a way that the x-coordinates of the vertices remain unchanged and the edges become non-crossing straight-line segments.
