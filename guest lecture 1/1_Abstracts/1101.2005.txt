Block Tensor Unfoldings;;; Stefan Ragnarsson,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Loan_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Charles F. Van Loan</a> ;;; Within the field of numerical multilinear algebra, block tensors are increasingly important. Accordingly, it is appropriate to develop an infrastructure that supports reasoning about block tensor computation. In this paper we establish concise notation that is suitable for the analysis and development of block tensor algorithms, prove several useful block tensor identities, and make precise the notion of a block tensor unfolding.
