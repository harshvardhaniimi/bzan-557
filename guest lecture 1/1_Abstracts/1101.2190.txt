Scaled Bregman divergences in a Tsallis scenario;;; R. C. Venkatesan,,  <a href="/find/cond-mat/1/au:+Plastino_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A. Plastino</a> ;;; There exist two different versions of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (K-Ld) in Tsallis statistics, namely the usual generalized K-Ld and the generalized Bregman K-Ld. Problems have been encountered in trying to reconcile them. A condition for consistency between these two generalized K-Ld-forms by recourse to the additive duality of Tsallis statistics is derived. It is also shown that the usual generalized K-Ld subjected to this additive duality, known as the dual generalized K-Ld, is a scaled Bregman divergence. This leads to an interesting conclusion: the dual generalized mutual information is a scaled Bregman information. The utility and implications of these results are discussed.
