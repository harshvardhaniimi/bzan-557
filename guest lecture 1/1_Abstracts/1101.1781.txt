Inclusion Ideals Associated to Uniformly Increasing Hypergraphs;;; Sarfraz Ahmad,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Anwar_I/0/1/0/all/0/1">Imran Anwar</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Haider_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Azeem Haider</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Inam_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Amina Inam</a> ;;; In this paper,we introduce the monomial ideals I(H) associated to a special class of non uniform hypergraphs H(X; E; d) namely uniformly increasing hypergraphs. These ideals are named as inclusion ideals. In this paper, we discuss some algebraic properties of these inclusion ideals. In particular, we give an upper bound of the Castlenouvo-Mumford regularity of the special dual ideal I^[*](H) of the inclusion ideal.
