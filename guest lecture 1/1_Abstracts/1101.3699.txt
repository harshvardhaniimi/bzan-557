On Intuitionistic Fuzzy Magnified Translation in Semigroups;;; Sujit Kumar Sardar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mandal_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Manasi Mandal</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Majumder_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Samit Kumar Majumder</a> ;;; The notion of intuitionistic fuzzy sets was introduced by Atanassov as a generalization of the notion of fuzzy sets. S.K Sardar and S.K. Majumder unified the idea of fuzzy translation and fuzzy multiplication of Vasantha Kandasamy to introduce the concept of fuzzy magnified translation in groups and semigroups. The purpose of this paper is to intuitionistically fuzzify(by using Atanassov's idea) the concept of fuzzy magnified translation in semigroups. Here among other results we obtain some characterization theorems of regular, intra-regular, left(right) regular semigroups in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy magnified translation.
