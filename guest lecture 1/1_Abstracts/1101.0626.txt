*-Quantizations of Fourier-Mukai transforms;;; D.Arinkin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Block_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">J.Block</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Pantev_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T.Pantev</a> ;;; We study deformations of Fourier-Mukai transforms in general complex analytic settings. We start with two complex manifolds X and Y together with a coherent Fourier-Mukai kernel P on their product. Suppose that P implements an equivalence between the coherent derived categories of X and Y. Given an arbitrary formal quantization of X we construct a unique quantization of Y such that the Fourier-Mukai transform deforms to an equivalence of the derived categories of the quantizations. Here quantizations are understood in the framework of stacks of algebroids.
