On Fuzzy Bi-ideals and Fuzzy Quasi Ideals in Gamma-Semigroups;;; Sujit Kumar Sardar,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Majumder_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Samit Kumar Majumder</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kayal_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Soumitra Kayal</a> ;;; The purpose of this paper is to investigate some properties of fuzzy ideals and fuzzy bi-ideals in gamma-semigroups and to introduce the notion of fuzzy quasi ideals in gamma-semigroups. Here we also characterize a regular gamma-semigroup in terms of fuzzy quasi ideals.
