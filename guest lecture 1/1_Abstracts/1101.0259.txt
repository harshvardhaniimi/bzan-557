On the Sum of Reciprocals of Amicable Numbers;;; Jonathan Bayless,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Klyve_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dominic Klyve</a> ;;; Two numbers $m$ and $n$ are considered amicable if the sum of their proper divisors, $s(n)$ and $s(m)$, satisfy $s(n) = m$ and $s(m) = n$. In 1981, Pomerance showed that the sum of the reciprocals of all such numbers, $P$, is a constant. We obtain both a lower and an upper bound on the value of $P$.
