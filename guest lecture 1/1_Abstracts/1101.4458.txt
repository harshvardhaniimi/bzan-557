Remarks on the Restricted Isometry Property in Orthogonal Matching  Pursuit algorithm;;; Qun Mo,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Shen_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yi Shen</a> ;;; This paper demonstrates theoretically that if the restricted isometry constant $\delta_K$ of the compressed sensing matrix satisfies $$ \delta_{K+1} &lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{K}+1}, $$ then a greedy algorithm called Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) can recover a signal with $K$ nonzero entries in $K$ iterations. In contrast, matrices are also constructed with restricted isometry constant $$ \delta_{K+1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{K}} $$ such that OMP can not recover $K$-sparse $x$ in $K$ iterations. This result shows that the conjecture given by Dai and Milenkovic is ture.
