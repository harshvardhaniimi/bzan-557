The support genus of certain Legendrian knots;;; Youlin Li,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wang_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jiajun Wang</a> ;;; In this paper, the support genus of all Legendrian right handed trefoil knots and some other Legendrian knots is computed. We give examples of Legendrian knots in the three-sphere with the standard contact structure which have positive support genus with arbitrarily negative Thurston-Benniquin invariant. This answers a question in Onaran.
