Identities involving values of Bernstein, q-Bernoulli and q-Euler  polynomials;;; A. Bayad,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Kim_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">T. Kim</a> ;;; In this paper we give some relation involving values of q-Bernoulli, q-Euler and Bernstein polynomials. From these relations, we obtain some interesting identities on the q-Bernoulli, q-Euler and Bernstein polynomials.
