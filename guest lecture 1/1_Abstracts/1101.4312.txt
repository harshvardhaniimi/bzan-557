The exterior degree of a pair of finite groups;;; Peyman Niroomand,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+rezaei_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Rashid rezaei</a> ;;; The exterior degree of a pair of finite groups $(G,N)$, which is a generalization of the exterior degree of finite groups, is the probability for two elements $(g,n)$ in $(G,N)$ such that $g\wedge n=1$. In the present paper, we state some relations between this concept and the relative commutatively degree, capability and the Schur multiplier of a pair of groups.
