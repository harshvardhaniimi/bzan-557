Strawderman</a> ;;; Consider estimating the n by p matrix of means of an n by p matrix of independent normally distributed observations with constant variance, where the performance of an estimator is judged using a p by p matrix quadratic error loss function. A matrix version of the James-Stein estimator is proposed, depending on a tuning constant. It is shown to dominate the usual maximum likelihood estimator for some choices of of the tuning constant when n is greater than or equal to 3. This result also extends to other shrinkage estimators and settings.
