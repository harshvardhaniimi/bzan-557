Improved Achievable Rates for Regularized Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding  in Multiuser MIMO Downlink;;; Bing Hui,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Mohaisen_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Manar Mohaisen</a>,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Chang_K/0/1/0/all/0/1">KyungHi Chang</a> ;;; Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) is considered as a prominent precoding scheme due to its capability to efficiently cancel out the known interference at the transmitter side. Therefore, the information rates achieved by THP are superior to those achieved by conventional linear precoding schemes. In this paper, a new lower bound on the achievable information rate for the regularized THP scheme under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with multiuser interference is derived. Analytical results show that the lower bound derived in this paper is tighter than the original lower bound particularly for a low SNR range, while all lower bounds converge to 0.5xlog2(6SNR/{\pi}e) as SNR approaches infinity.
