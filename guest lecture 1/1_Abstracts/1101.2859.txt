Frames and Semi-Frames;;; Jean-Pierre Antoine,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Balazs_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Peter Balazs</a> ;;; Loosely speaking, a semi-frame is a generalized frame for which one of the frame bounds is absent. More precisely, given a total sequence in a Hilbert space, we speak of an upper (resp. lower) semi-frame if only the upper (resp. lower) frame bound is valid. Equivalently, for an upper semi-frame, the frame operator is bounded, but has an unbounded inverse, whereas a lower semi-frame has an unbounded frame operator, with bounded inverse. We study mostly upper semi-frames, both in the continuous case and in the discrete case, and give some remarks for the dual situation. In particular, we show that reconstruction is still possible in certain cases.
