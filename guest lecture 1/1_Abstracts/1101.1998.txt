Regular algebras of dimension 4 with 3 generators;;; D. Rogalski,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zhang_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">J. J. Zhang</a> ;;; We study Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension 4 with three generators of degree one. We classify those which are domains and which have an additional Z x Z-grading, and prove that all of these examples are also strongly noetherian, Auslander regular, and Cohen-Macaulay.
