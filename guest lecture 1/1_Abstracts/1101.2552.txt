A note on approximate subgroups of GL_n(C) and uniformly nonamenable  groups;;; Emmanuel Breuillard,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Green_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ben Green</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tao_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Terence Tao</a> ;;; The aim of this brief note is to offer another proof of a theorem of Hrushovski that approximate subgroups of GL_n(C) are almost nilpotent. This approach generalizes to uniformly non amenable groups.
