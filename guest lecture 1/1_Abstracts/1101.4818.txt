An algebraic model for free rational G-spectra;;; J.P.C.Greenlees,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Shipley_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">B.E.Shipley</a> ;;; We show that for any compact Lie group $G$ with identity component $N$ and component group $W=G/N$, the category of free rational $G$-spectra is equivalent to the category of torsion modules over the twisted group ring $H^*(BN)[W]$. This gives an algebraic classification of rational $G$-equivariant cohomology theories on free $G$-spaces and a practical method for calculating the groups of natural transformations between them. This uses the methods of <a href="/abs/1101.2511">arXiv:1101.2511</a>, and some readers may find the simpler context of the present paper highlights the main thread of the argument.
