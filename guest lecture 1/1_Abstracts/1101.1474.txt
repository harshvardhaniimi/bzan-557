Long-Wave Instability of Advective Flows in Inclined Layer with Solid  Heat Conductive Boundaries;;; R. V. Sagitov,,  <a href="/find/physics/1/au:+Sharifulin_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">A. N. Sharifulin</a> ;;; We investigate the stability of the steady convective flow in a plane tilted layer with ideal thermal conductivity of solid boundaries in the presence of uniform longitudinal temperature gradient. Analytically found the stability boundary with respect to the long-wave perturbations, find the critical Grashof number for the most dangerous among them of even spiral perturbation.
