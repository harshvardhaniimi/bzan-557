Power sums of Coxeter exponents;;; John M. Burns,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Suter_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ruedi Suter</a> ;;; Consider an irreducible finite Coxeter system. We show that for any nonnegative integer n the sum of the nth powers of the Coxeter exponents can be written uniformly as a polynomial in four parameters: h (the Coxeter number), r (the rank), and two further parameters.
