Some Semi - Equivelar Maps;;; Ashish K. Upadhyay,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tiwari_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Anand K. Tiwari</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Maity_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dipendu Maity</a> ;;; Semi-Equivelar maps are generalizations of Archimedean Solids (as are equivelar maps of the Platonic solids) to the surfaces other than $2-$Sphere. We classify some semi equivelar maps on surface of Euler characteristic -1 and show that none of these are vertex transitive. We establish existence of 12-covered triangulations for this surface. We further construct double cover of these maps to show existence of semi-equivelar maps on the surface of double torus. We also construct several semi-equivelar maps on the surfaces of Euler characteristics -8 and -10 and on non-orientable surface of Euler characteristics -2.
