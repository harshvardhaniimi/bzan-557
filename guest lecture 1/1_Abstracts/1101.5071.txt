On bar lengths in partitions;;; Jean-Baptiste Gramain,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Olsson_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jorn B. Olsson</a> ;;; In this paper, we present, given a odd integer $d$, a decomposition of the multiset of bar lengths of a bar partition $\lambda$ as the union of two multisets, one consisting of the bar lengths in its $\bar{d}$-core partition $\bar{c}_d(\lambda)$ and the other consisting of modified bar lengths in its $\bar{d}$-quotient partition. In particular, we obtain that the multiset of bar lengths in $\bar{c}_d(\lambda)$ is a sub-multiset of the multiset of bar lengths in $\lambda$. Also we obtain a relative bar formula for the degrees of spin characters of the Schur extensions of the symmetric group. The proof involves a recent similar result for partitions, proved in [1].
