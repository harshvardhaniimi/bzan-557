A Formula representing magnetic Berezin transforms on the Bergman ball  of $\C^n$ as functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator;;; Allal Ghanmi,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mouayn_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zouhair Mouayn</a> ;;; We give a formula that represents magnetic Berezin transforms associated with generalized Bergman spaces as functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the Bergman ball. In particular, we recover the result obtained by J. Peeter [J. Oper. Theory, 24, 1990].
