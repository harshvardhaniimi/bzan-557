A Novel Unified Expression for the Capacity and Bit Error Probability of  Wireless Communication Systems over Generalized Fading Channels;;; Ferkan Yilmaz,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Alouini_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mohamed-Slim Alouini</a> ;;; Analysis of the average binary error probabilities (ABEP) and average capacity (AC) of wireless communications systems over generalized fading channels have been considered separately in the past. This paper introduces a novel moment generating function (MGF)-based \emph{unified expression} for the ABEP and AC of single and multiple link communication with maximal ratio combining. In addition, this paper proposes the hyper-Fox's H fading model as a unified fading distribution of a majority of the well-known generalized fading models. As such, we offer a generic unified performance expression that can be easily calculated and that is applicable to a wide variety of fading scenarios. The mathematical formalism is illustrated with some selected numerical examples that validate the correctness of our newly derived results.
