Transport and concentration processes in the multidimensional  zero-pressure gas dynamics model with the energy conservation law;;; S. Albeverio,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Rozanova_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">O.S. Rozanova</a>,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Shelkovich_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">V.M. Shelkovich</a> ;;; We introduce integral identities to define delta-shock wave type solutions for the multidimensional zero-pressure gas dynamics Using these integral identities, the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for delta-shocks are obtained. We derive the balance laws describing mass, momentum, and energy transport from the area outside the delta-shock wave front onto this front. These processes are going on in such a way that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved and at the same time mass and energy of the moving delta-shock wave front are increasing quantities. In addition, the total kinetic energy transfers into the total internal energy. The process of propagation of delta-shock waves is also described. These results can be used in modeling of mediums which can be treated as a {pressureless continuum} (dusty gases, two-phase flows with solid particles or droplets, granular gases).
