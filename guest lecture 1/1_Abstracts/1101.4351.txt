Building a Chaotic Proved Neural Network;;; Jacques M. Bahi,,  <a href="/find/cs/1/au:+Guyeux_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Christophe Guyeux</a>,  <a href="/find/cs/1/au:+Salomon_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Michel Salomon</a> ;;; Chaotic neural networks have received a great deal of attention these last years. In this paper we establish a precise correspondence between the so-called chaotic iterations and a particular class of artificial neural networks: global recurrent multi-layer perceptrons. We show formally that it is possible to make these iterations behave chaotically, as defined by Devaney, and thus we obtain the first neural networks proven chaotic. Several neural networks with different architectures are trained to exhibit a chaotical behavior.
