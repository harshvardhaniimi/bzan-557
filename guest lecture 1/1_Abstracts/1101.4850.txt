The Restriction Theorem for Fully Nonlinear Subequations;;; F. Reese Harvey,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lawson_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">H. Blaine Lawson, Jr</a> ;;; Let X be a submanifold of a manifold Z. We address the question: When do viscosity sub-solutions of a fully nonlinear partial differential equation on Z, restrict to be viscosity sub-solutions of the restricted equation on X? It is not always true. In this paper we formulate a general result which guarantees good restriction. This is then applied to a long list of analytically and geometrically interesting cases.
