Losano</a>,  <a href="/find/hep-th/1/au:+Guilarte_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">J. Mateos Guilarte</a> ;;; In this work we introduce new scalar field models and study the defect solutions they may engender. The investigation is based on the deformation procedure, which greatly simplify the calculations, leading us to new models together with the corresponding solutions in a simple and powerful manner.
