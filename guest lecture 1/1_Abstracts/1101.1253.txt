On Koszul duality for Kac-Moody groups;;; Roman Bezrukavnikov,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Yun_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zhiwei Yun</a> ;;; For any Kac-Moody group $G$ with Borel $B$, we give a monoidal equivalence between the derived category of $B$-equivariant mixed complexes on the flag variety $G/B$ and (a certain completion of) the derived category of $B^\vee$-monodromic mixed complexes on the enhanced flag variety $G^\vee/U^\vee$, here $G^\vee$ is the Langlands dual of $G$. We also prove variants of this equivalence, one of which is the equivalence between the derived category of $U$-equivariant mixed complexes on the partial flag variety $G/P$ and certain "Whittaker model" category of mixed complexes on $G^\vee/B^\vee$. In all these equivalences, intersection cohomology sheaves correspond to (free-monodromic) tilting sheaves. Our results generalize the Koszul duality patterns for reductive groups in the work of Beilinson, Ginzburg and Soergel .
