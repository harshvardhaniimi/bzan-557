Some results on the well-posedness of Euler-Voigt and  Navier-Stokes-Voigt models;;; Luigi C. Berselli,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Bisconti_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Luca Bisconti</a> ;;; We consider the Euler-Voigt equations and the Navier-Stokes-Voigt equations, which are obtained by an inviscid alpha-regularization from the corresponding equations. The main result we show is the structural stability of the system in term of the variations of both viscosity of regularization parameters.
