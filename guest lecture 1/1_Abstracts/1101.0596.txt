Internal DLA and the Gaussian free field;;; David Jerison,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Levine_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Lionel Levine</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Sheffield_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Scott Sheffield</a> ;;; In previous works, we showed that the internal DLA cluster on \Z^d with t particles is a.s. spherical up to a maximal error of O(\log t) if d=2 and O(\sqrt{\log t}) if d &gt; 2. This paper addresses "average error": in a certain sense, the average deviation of internal DLA from its mean shape is of constant order when d=2 and of order r^{1-d/2} (for a radius r cluster) in general. Appropriately normalized, the fluctuations (taken over time and space) scale to a variant of the Gaussian free field.
